              "{'text': ' At around 10:00 p.m. on November 10  2013  Employee #1  with Villager  Construction Inc.  with a coworker  were using an asphalt milling machine  (Wirtgen; Model Number: W2100) to grind out existing asphalt from an  interstate at a railroad bridge overpass. Employee # 1 was standing on the  ground  checking the depth of the cut into the asphalt  using a handheld  pendant attached to the machine. The pedant could stretch out from ten to 15  ft. This allowed Employee #1 to walk back and forth  checking the cut. The  operator was on the top of the milling machine  controlling the operation of  the machine and ensuring that the milling machine and dump truck (driven by a  second coworker  who worked for an independent trucking service) kept a safe  working distance. A different company  Protective Services Inc. (PSI)  was  responsible for the traffic control of the job site and had shut down the  inside lane of a three lane section of the interstate  so that work could be  conducted on that lane. The entire work zone was approximately two miles long   from start to finish. Employee #1 and the operator of the milling machine had  completed milling four sections (eight total passes) of the inside lane at the  bridge overpasses and were waiting for PSI to shut down the center lane. Dual  lane shut down of the inside and center lanes of the interstate was completed  around 9:30 p.m.  and Employee #1 and the milling machine operator milled two  sections (four total passes) of the center lane. Once both sides of the  overpass were milled out  approximately 200 ft on each side  Employee #1 and  the operator of the milling machine moved the milling machine down the  interstate  approximately1 000 ft  to a railroad overpass and began setting up  to mill the center lane sections. The truck driver backed his truck into  position and remained in the truck to move the truck slowly forward as milling  took place. Employee #1 was positioned between the milling machine and the  concrete median dividers  inside the coned off work zone. The lanes of travel  were approximately 12 ft wide  so the milling machine made two passes  since  it can only cut seven ft wide on each section to cover the entire lane.  Employee #1 was standing approximately three ft in the far inside lane on the  ground between milling machine and interior median wall inside of the approved  traffic control set up  and approximately midway up the machine and 17 ft from  the traffic control devices and flow of traffic. The milling machine was  approximately nine ft wide by 50 ft long  while operating. Employee #1 was  guarded by the machine from the flow of traffic. Approximately five to ten  minutes into the first pass  the milling machine operator noticed lights  hitting the reflectors on the inside wall and turned briefly to see a vehicle  coming. The operator thought it was the Project manager coming to check on the  status of the project. Then  the operator realized that the oncoming vehicle  was not equipped with a strobe  as required in work zones. The operator turned  and yelled for Employee # 1 to run for safety  as a Chevrolet Tahoe came down  the inside lane where Employee #1 was standing. The driver of the Tahoe  continued traveling in the far inside lane of the work zone  where Employee #1  was struck and thrown some 100 ft from where he was originally standing. The  vehicle was moving approximately 45 mph per hour. As he was transferred to a  hospital by emergency personnel  Employee #1 was treated for severe trauma   lacerations  fractures  and contusions to the body and head. Employee #1 was  pronounced dead at the hospital. The driver of the vehicle disregarded the  traffic control set up  all warning lights on the rear of the milling machine   and cone spacing of 100 ft. The construction work zone was set up correctly  with all signage  cone spacing  tapering  attenuators  and lighting; all of  the traffic control set up was approved by MUTCD for this type of tr ',\n",

            " At around 10:00 p.m. on November 10  2013  Employee #1  with Villager  Construction Inc.  with a coworker  were using an asphalt milling machine  (Wirtgen; Model Number: W2100) to grind out existing asphalt from an  interstate at a railroad bridge overpass. Employee # 1 was standing on the  ground  checking the depth of the cut into the asphalt  using a handheld  pendant attached to the machine. The pedant could stretch out from ten to 15  ft. This allowed Employee #1 to walk back and forth  checking the cut. The  operator was on the top of the milling machine  controlling the operation of  the machine and ensuring that the milling machine and dump truck (driven by a  second coworker  who worked for an independent trucking service) kept a safe  working distance. A different company  Protective Services Inc. (PSI)  was  responsible for the traffic control of the job site and had shut down the  inside lane of a three lane section of the interstate  so that work could be  conducted on that lane. The entire work zone was approximately two miles long   from start to finish. Employee #1 and the operator of the milling machine had  completed milling four sections (eight total passes) of the inside lane at the  bridge overpasses and were waiting for PSI to shut down the center lane. Dual  lane shut down of the inside and center lanes of the interstate was completed  around 9:30 p.m.  and Employee #1 and the milling machine operator milled two  sections (four total passes) of the center lane. Once both sides of the  overpass were milled out  approximately 200 ft on each side  Employee #1 and  the operator of the milling machine moved the milling machine down the  interstate  approximately1 000 ft  to a railroad overpass and began setting up  to mill the center lane sections. The truck driver backed his truck into  position and remained in the truck to move the truck slowly forward as milling  took place. Employee #1 was positioned between the milling machine and the  concrete median dividers  inside the coned off work zone. The lanes of travel  were approximately 12 ft wide  so the milling machine made two passes  since  it can only cut seven ft wide on each section to cover the entire lane.  Employee #1 was standing approximately three ft in the far inside lane on the  ground between milling machine and interior median wall inside of the approved  traffic control set up  and approximately midway up the machine and 17 ft from  the traffic control devices and flow of traffic. The milling machine was  approximately nine ft wide by 50 ft long  while operating. Employee #1 was  guarded by the machine from the flow of traffic. Approximately five to ten  minutes into the first pass  the milling machine operator noticed lights  hitting the reflectors on the inside wall and turned briefly to see a vehicle  coming. The operator thought it was the Project manager coming to check on the  status of the project. Then  the operator realized that the oncoming vehicle  was not equipped with a strobe  as required in work zones. The operator turned  and yelled for Employee # 1 to run for safety  as a Chevrolet Tahoe came down  the inside lane where Employee #1 was standing. The driver of the Tahoe  continued traveling in the far inside lane of the work zone  where Employee #1  was struck and thrown some 100 ft from where he was originally standing. The  vehicle was moving approximately 45 mph per hour. As he was transferred to a  hospital by emergency personnel  Employee #1 was treated for severe trauma   lacerations  fractures  and contusions to the body and head. Employee #1 was  pronounced dead at the hospital. The driver of the vehicle disregarded the  traffic control set up  all warning lights on the rear of the milling machine   and cone spacing of 100 ft. The construction work zone was set up correctly  with all signage  cone spacing  tapering  attenuators  and lighting; all of  the traffic control set up was approved by MUTCD for this type of tr \n",
