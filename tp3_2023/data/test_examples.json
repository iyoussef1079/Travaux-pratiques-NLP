        "text": "At 10:30 p.m. on January 9  2013  Employee #1  a crane operator employed by  Concrete General Inc.  along with Coworker #1  a rigger  and Coworker #2  a  laborer  were using a mobile crane as part of a bridge repair project. The  crane was a boom truck that was being operated in a closed 11-foot lane  the  fast lane  on one of two bridges  the westbound bridge. Employee #1 operated  the crane without the outriggers extended and with only the jacks down. This  was because the single lane closure did not allow sufficient space to extend  the 17-foot outriggers. The crane was being used to remove the temporary work  platform located on the inside of the bridge. The needle beams were being  removed from under the work platform and were being loaded onto a flatbed  truck that was parked behind the crane. Each beam weighed 1 796 pounds and  measured 21 feet in length. Employee #1 lifted four beams with the crane. He  was removing the fifth beam when that beam started swinging. Employee #1 lost  control of the load and the crane. The crane tipped over and the boom landed  on the eastbound bridge. Employee #1 sustained a knee injury. He was  transported to a hospital  where he received treatment for a knee  bruise/abrasion. He then was released. Maryland OSHA's investigation  determined that the crane collapsed between the 50-foot span of the two  bridges  above the creek that ran 60 feet below. At the time of the collapse   the crane's hydraulic boom was extended to 58 feet and the boom angle was 65  feet. The load chart requires that the boom angle be at a maximum of 45 feet  with the boom extended to 58 feet. Therefore  the crane was being operated  outside the safe parameters required by the manufacturer's load charts.  Employee #1 and his two coworkers were exposed to struck-by hazards while  working with the mobile crane.",

It had no safety guard and its screw-in handle  was missing. After trying several new SAIT 22021 type-27 4.5-in. wheels that  day  he selected a wheel comparable to the rated rpm rate of the grinder. He  first cut was an approximately 8-in length off the bucket and experienced some  wheel binding and jerking problems. His supervisor then explained to him that  he needed to cut off more steel on the same bucket  and that he needed to cut  at an angle to avoid disturbing other components of the grinder. After the  supervisor left  Employee #1 began cutting at an approximately 45-degree  angle. The wheel snagged the body of the grinder  causing the abrasive wheel  to break apart and dislocated from the spindle. Flying debris ejected from the  grinder and struck Employee #1 in his face. Employee #1 was not wearing a face  shield  but was wearing ANSI labeled safety glasses. The impact of the flying  debris upon his face caused two facial lacerations and a broken nose. He was  transported to a medical center  where he was hospitalized for surgical  procedures and postoperative care and then released four days later. Citations  issued were a failure to use a grinder guard  sound and check the RPM before  the wheel was used  to receive training for grinder safety  and use eye and  face protection.",

Employee #1  a plumber's assistant  was assembling a pipe section to a  ball valve. He was using a pipe and bolt threading machine  Ridge Tool Company  Model 1822-I. This machine is operated by a foot- switch pedal. The  foot-switch pedal is like the gas pedal of a car: when you step on it  the  machine starts rotating; when you step off it  the machine stops rotating.  Employee #1 was using the machine to grip the pipe in a fixed position. He was  using his right hand to thread the valve onto the stationary section of the  pipe. Employee #1 had his right hand on the pipe and under the ball valve. He  unintentionally activated the machine via the foot-switch pedal. The machine  started to rotate  and the pipe rotated toward Employee #1. His fingers were  trapped between the valve handle and the valve body. Employee #1 immediately  either released the foot-switch pedal or kicked it away. Coworker #1  who was  approximately 5 feet away  came and turned off the machine using the  on/off-type switch on the side of the machine. However  the machine had  already rotated enough to break Employee #1 right index finger by bending it  backwards. Emergency services were called  and Employee #1 was transported to  the hospital  where he underwent surgery to repair the fractured right index  finger. The subsequent investigation of this event determined that the injury  was caused by the machine unintentionally being activated by Employee #1 via  the foot pedal while his hand was on the pipe being gripped by the pipe and  bolt threading machine. Employee #1 was a full-time employee of the employer.",

Employee #1 was working  alone  removing safety brackets  with an acetylene torch (oxy-acetylene)  from  the column supporting the trellis. The trellis brackets were about 18 ft above  the ground. Employee #1 noticed that the steel tube connecting the trellis to  the northwest column was not straight. Employee #1 was the foreman responsible  for safety and the proper installation of the trellis at the site. Employee #1  decided that the welded connection at the northwest column was unacceptable  and had to be repaired. Employee #1 used an acetylene torch (oxy-acetylene) to  cut the bottom weld on the steel tube connecting the trellis to the northwest  column. When the bottom weld was cut  the weight of the trellis was too great  for the remaining welds to support the 15 000 pound structural steel trellis.  This action allowed the northwest corner of the trellis to fall approximately  two ft and trap Employee #1 between the trellis and the wall. Apparently  the  structural design of the structure was modified by an unqualified foreman   when he removed structural welds. This caused the remaining welds to fail  under the load  and allow the structure to fall. Employee #1 was transported  to the hospital  and he was admitted for over 24 hours  for chest and facial  fractures.",

The coworker in the  bucket was able to move out of the way of the falling branch  which then  struck Employee #1 in the back of the head  striking his forehead against the  top rail of the aerial lift bucket.

The crew consisted of a supervisor  the owner of the company  and  two other employees that were working together to demo the building. The group  had cut the top of four out of the five southwestern most main support beams  earlier that day with no issues. They moved to the northwestern beams and  began cutting the top of four out of five beams  but could not get the I-beam  piece out. After breaking a new 0.625 in. diameter choker  they tried to  extract the piece out  but could not. It was then decided by the owner   supervisor and Employee #1 to cut the bottom of the beam to get the roof to  collapse. Employee #1 made the pre-cuts (cutting the beam  but not cutting all  the way through the beam)  and then he went to the ground in the aerial lift  to get a choker and shackles to attach the lower piece of the beam to the arm  of the Hi-Lo machine that was located on the south end of the building. Once  elevated back to the beam that was pre-cut  Employee #1 attached the shackles  and choker to the arm of the Hi-Lo machine and the cut beam. Employee #1 made  the final cuts to the beam. Employee #1 started down in the aerial lift that  was located on the north end of the building. Instead of booming to the left  (away from the building) and then down  Employee #1 came straight down the  west side of the building. Every other time  Employee #1 had boomed away from  the building and then down according to the owner. As Employee #1 reached  approximately 80 ft above the ground  the roof above the I-beam collapsed. The  piece of the beam that was attached to the Hi-Lo arm swung out and hit  Employee #1 in the back of the neck area  pushing him against the controls of  the aerial lift. The owner of the company went to the lower controls of the  aerial lift and lowered the basket to the ground. By the time the basket was  on the ground  the plant nurses and first responders were on site and started  medical attention on Employee #1. Emergency medical personnel transported  Employee #1 to a county hospital. Employee #1 had received multiple blunt  force injuries to the head  neck  and chest and died at the hospital.",

Emergency services were called  and the San Mateo Fire Department responded.  Employee #1 was transported to the hospital  where he was admitted and treated  for multiple facial fractures. He was hospitalized for approximately three  days. This event was reported to Cal/OSHA by the San Mateo Fire Department and  the Employer at approximately 8:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.  respectively  on July  18  2013. Cal/OSHA initiated its investigation at the work site at  approximately 10:15 a.m. on July 30  2013. Participating in the inspection  were Employee #1's foreman/supervisor  the project superintendent of the  general contractor  and the field operations manager of the general  contractor. The investigation revealed that Employee #1's employer had leased  the scissor lift from Sunstate Equipment since October 16  2012. The employer  returned the scissor lift to Sunstate Equipment on July 19  2013  the day  after Employee #1 was injured. While the equipment was in the employer's  possession  the lift's relay switch was replaced to correct a steering  problem  and the platform control box was replaced due to the lift's inability  to go up. Cal/OSHA did not issue an Accident-Related citation  because the  investigation determined that the cause was not a violation of Title 8   California Code of Regulations (T8 CCR). However  Cal/OSHA issued one General  Citation for the employer's failure to train and instruct its employee in the  proper use of Skyjack III 3219 Scissor Lift  in accordance with the  manufacturer's operating instructions  and Section 3203  Injury and Illness  Prevention Program  a violation of T8 CCR  Section 3638(d).",

He was working as a drywall taper  spotting  screws in the drywall in the main area of the warehouse from his position on a  scissor lift (aerial lift). Employee #1 fell to the concrete floor of that  working level. Coworker #1  employed by an electrical subcontractor also  working at the facility  found Employee #1 lying prone  unconscious and  bleeding from a laceration on his forehead. Emergency services were called   and the Fullerton Fire Department responded. Employee #1 was transported to  University of California Irvine Medical Center (UCI)  where he was admitted  for observation and treatment of a head injury. The Fullerton Fire Department  reported this event to Cal/OSHA on May 7  2013. Cal/OSHA's subsequent  investigation determined that there were no witnesses to Employee #1's fall.  In addition  Employee #1 did not respond to attempts to be interviewed. The  investigation did establish that work at the site began at 6:00 a.m. on May 7   2013  and that the workers all took their lunch break at 10:30 a.m. After the  lunch break  Employee #1 continued with his assigned work and was alone on one  side of the facility for approximately 20 minutes before he was found on the  floor at approximately 12:24 p.m. by Coworker #1  the subcontractor. When  found  Employee #1 was lying on the floor approximately 6 feet away from the  scissor lift  which was in the down and stowed position. Employee #1 had  worked as a drywall finisher for more than 11 years and had been a member of  the Drywall Finishers Regional Local Union 1136 since 2001. He was certified  as an aerial lift power user and had received other specialized training  related to his work from the union as well as site specific safety training  from the employer.",

His assignment was to paint the  exterior awning of a commercial building. Witness #1 exited the building and  noticed Employee #1 in the aerial lift  but Employee #1 was not moving and  appeared to be slumped over the aerial lift controls and caught between the  aerial lift rails and the steel awning structure of the building. Witness #1  went back into the building to summon help for Employee #1. Witness #2 was  inside the building and heard that Employee #1 was outside the building in the  aerial lift  and that he needed help. Witness #2 proceeded outside to  investigate and attempted to communicate with Employee #1 in the aerial lift.  Witness #2 climbed the boom of the aerial lift and attempted to move the  basket of the aerial lift by manually pushing and pulling the basket of the  aerial lift so it would dislodge Employee #1 from between the building and the  aerial lift basket rails. Witness #2 stated Employee #1 was pinned by the neck  between the aerial lift basket rail located above the control panel and the  steel poles that formed the awning structure on the exterior of the building.  Witness #2 was able to free Employee #1 from between the building structure  and the basket rail of the aerial lift. Employee #1 was wearing a fall  protection body harness and a portion of the harness was wrapped around the  move/steer joystick lever of the aerial lift and the lever was stuck in the  down position. Witness #2 dislodged the fall protection harness from the  joystick lever and was able to dislodge Employee #1 from between the structure  of the building and the aerial lift basket rail so CPR could be administered.  Witness #2 stated he attempted to move the different control levers on the  aerial lift but the lift was not running and the movement of the control  levers did not activate the aerial lift. Witness #3  a construction worker  from across the street  came over to the job site after hearing that Employee  #1 was pinned by the aerial lift. Witness #3 went to the aerial lift and  started the unit from the ground position. Witness #3 was able to lower the  aerial lift basket to the ground where Employee #1 was then removed from the  basket of the aerial lift and attended to by rescue personnel. Employee #1 was  taken to a nearby hospital and pronounced dead. The autopsy report stated the  cause of death was asphyxiation by mechanical compression of the neck and  chest. The cause of the accident was determined to be operator error.",

The aerial lift was later tested and problems were  identified with the control stick which controlled upward movement of the  boom. The control stick would not self-center or stop movement of the boom  when released slowly as required by the manufacturer. Examination of the  control stick found that hardened and compacted granular material built up on  the centering ring and spring prevented the control stick from centering.  There was also an absence of grease or lubricant on the centering ring and  spring. Once the granular material was removed  the control stick functioned  properly and self centered.",

An  Ingersol Rand hydraulic lift (Model VR-1056  Serial Number 167290  113CH6  35-218500A) was approximately 60 ft in length and was used to position  60-foot  1 000 pound metal trusses on to the vertical uprights of the barn  structure. A 0.375 in. rope was connected to vertical uprights with a white  rope attached to the north beam on the ground  positioned at top and connected  to a fence at north side as well as a yellow rope that connected to the beam.  The steel trusses would eventually hold up the roof of the barn. While  Employee #1 was at ground level retrieving a tool from the box of hydraulic  lift  a beam positioned approximately 25 ft above Employee #1 fell and struck  him in the head. The Employee #1 died on the scene and was transferred by  County of Los Angeles Department of Coroner. Employee #1 sustained traumatic  head injuries. The causal factor of the accident was the metal truss beam was  released from the hoisting apparatus without being effectively secured or  supported in position as to prevent it from being dislodged from position.  Factors that may cause truss being dislodged may include but not limited to  environmental conditions such as the wind. Delmar Vandam dba High Desert Dairy  was a dairy farm that conducts general farming activities  dairy  manufacturing  baling hay and barn construction.",

The workers had been at  the site on two previous occasions to expose framing members by removing  drywall and then to enclosed the subject area with plastic sheeting. Because  test results from an independent testing lab showed that mold was still  present  Employees #1 and #2 returned to the apartment unit a third time to  encapsulate the mold. Employees #1 and #2 were spraying Kilz(R) Original  Aerosol to encapsulate visible mold that was on the framing members of an  interior partition wall of the apartment unit  while inside the  plastic-enclosed containment area. The homeowner was in the kitchen area of  the apartment. Employees #1 and #2 exhausted four and one-half  13-ounce-sized  cans of the flammable aerosol within the containment area  which measured 41  inches deep by 8 feet long by 8 feet  10 inches high. They then plugged into  an electrical outlet an OmniAire 1000V HEPA air filtration machine  which was  also inside the containment area. An explosion and fire occurred  when an  ignition source was introduced inside the containment area where flammable  vapors were concentrated. Employees #1 and #2 sustained serious burns (second  and third degree) to their upper bodies and faces. They required inpatient  hospitalization for more than 24 hours. According to the manufacturer   OmniAire 1000V was an air filtering machine designed for filtering  particulates and providing negative air pressure for asbestos abatement. The  machine was listed as meeting requirements for UL (Underwriters Laboratories)  Standard UL507 for Safety for Electric Fans. The listing did not include use  in hazardous atmospheres  where flammable vapors were present. The machine had  a variable speed controller and Emerson  open-frame type fan motor. The  investigation found that the employer's IIPP (Injury and Illness Prevention  Program) lacked several required elements and that the workers were not  trained on the physical or health hazards of the Kilz(R) Original Aerosol.  Further  the improper use of listed equipment in a hazardous atmosphere caused  the explosion and fire. The employer was issued citations accordingly.",

During  interviews with Employee #1 stated that there was no atmospheric testing or  continuous monitoring while they were inside the excavation. The employer  admitted that he did not conduct any testing of the area. He usually had an  independent contractor conduct the testing for him  but apparently that had  not been done at this site. The employees had not received any training in  excavation work or hazardous atmospheres. The employer does not have any  safety programs in place for his company. CSHO went to the site and collected  air samples from the man hole that was put in by the employer and found that  it did contain some H2S and an elevated LEL. The Medical Examiner's office  ruled that Employee #1 died from Atherosclerotic and hypertensive  cardiovascular disease. The Harris County Medical Examiner's Office did not  test for H2S.",

Employee #1 was in the center of the runway   working alone approximately 300 feet from the end that led to the plane  loading area and hangars. A pilot flying an airplane  Schweizer Aircraft  Corporation Model G-164 B  approached the airstrip from the opposite end and  landed. As the pilot taxied the plane toward the hangar  the plane's propeller  struck Employee #1 in the head and decapitated him. This fatality was reported  to Cal/OSHA's Sacramento District Office by the Butte County Sheriff's  Department on May 9  2013. The employer failed to report the event. Cal/OSHA's  investigation determined that  because of the plane's design (tail dragger)   there was limited pilot visibility looking forward and no visibility below the  engine compartment (nose) while taxiing. Preliminary reports indicated there  were no spotters. Employee #1 was not wearing a safety vest  and he may have  been hearing impaired.",

The airline commuter terminal was still in operation  at the time of  the incident. This required construction of temporary walls to separate  airline passengers from the construction activity. Employees #1 and a coworker  were removing a temporary wall that had served this purpose. The top track of  the temporary wall had been attached to the ceiling with double sided tape   and they were removing the top track from the ceiling. The coworker was on a  scissor lift  using a crow bar to pry the top track off the ceiling  and then  he would hand the top track sections to employee #1 to stack them on the floor  for later disposal. As the coworker was pried a section of top track from the  ceiling  a (20 ft by 22 ft) suspended lath and stucco ceiling dislodged from  the roof decking  where it had been secured with sheet metal screws  and fell  onto Employee #1  knocking him to the ground and trapped him under the debris.  The supervisor  who was about 10 ft away when the roof collapsed  went to help  Employee #1 and lifted the ceiling enough for him get out from under the  ceiling debris. Employee #1 sustained a fractured little toe on his right  foot  and a left shoulder rotator tear he was treated and released from the  emergency room and the coworker sustained a laceration to his left arm  requiring sutures at a local industrial clinic.",

It was working on a new taxiway at Los Angeles  International Airport  which had to be thick enough to support new jumbo jets.  The finished surface was to be nineteen inches thick. As part of the  preparation work  an old asphalt-covered taxiway was being demolished. The  area had been marked by \"Dig Alert\" to indicate buried electrical lines. There  were electrical vaults in front of the tractor about twenty yards away  to the  right of the tractor about 3 yards away  and behind the tractor about fifty  yards away. The asphalt had been marked in red where the wires entered and  exited the vaults  and on the asphalt in front of the tractor. There was no  marking  however  on the side of the vault to the operator's right to indicate  any lines entering it. The job being performed at the time of the accident was  \"potholing\" for soil samples to test for chemical contamination. Because the  lines entering the nearby vault had not been marked  the operator assumed  there were no cables where he was digging. As he dug  he contacted conductors  energized at 34.5 kilovolts approximately twelve inches below the surface. He  had been well trained  and as a result he stayed in the cab of his tractor  until emergency crews deenergized the conductors. This took approximately 3  hours. Employee #1 was not injured.",

Employee #1 looked at the  schematics  and it appeared that the juncture box was in the fan room where  Employee #1 located an unmarked junction box which was the same color and  dimensions that held the wires on the other floors. This box (18 in. by 18  in.)  however  turned out to be 480 volts. The coworker loosened four screws  in the corners and was holding the screwdriver when he began to lift and to  pull the cover away from the box. While doing this  the coworker tilted the  cover and touched it inside the box. When the coworker did this  an arc  flashed that threw both Employee #1 and the coworker back. Employee #1  sustained burn injuries to his face and hands. Employee #1 later learned there  was no junction box holding the missing wires. The wires had been spliced and  dropped in one of the pipes. Employee #1 instructed his coworker to open an  unmarked box that should have been marked with voltage  amps and other  identifying information. The coworker did not have electrical training. The  coworker was a full-time permanent employee of the employer with no other  contracts. Employee #1 was hospitalized.",

        "text": "On September 14  2011  Employee #1 was working as a laborer on a highway  milling project. Employee #1 was assigned to operate a jackhammer where needed  after the milling machine conducted its passes over the bridge. Employee #1  was also assigned the task of maintaining the traffic pattern for the  equipment. The traffic pattern was set up by the worksite foreman  the  Bobcat/Trimmer operator  and Employee #1  working in coordination with the  Connecticut State Police. Once the traffic pattern was established  the  milling machine  a sweeper  a Bobcat machine and a trimming machine were moved  over into the closed portion of the southbound Route 9 highway. The plan of  work for the evening was to mill the pavement of the bridge surface from zero  on the north side of the bridge  to 1.5 inches over the bridge surface and  back to zero on the south side of the bridge. The sweeper operator positioned  the sweeper behind the milling machine and waited for the milling machine to  conduct its first pass over the bridge. The Bobcat/Trimmer operator drove a  water truck into the traffic pattern and parked the truck. The Bobcat/Trimmer  operator then accessed the Trimming machine and waited for the milling machine  to conduct its first pass over the bridge. There were also several dump trucks  on site  and they were lined up just south of the bridge along the east side  of the highway. The milling machine conducted its first pass over the bridge  along the far east side of the bridge in a north to south direction or in the  same direction as traffic along the southbound side of the highway. The first  pass over the bridge was a full milling pass measuring 7 feet 2 inches wide.  The sweeper ran or operated behind the milling machine. The milling machine  backed up and repositioned itself on the north side of the bridge to perform  its second pass just west of the first pass. While the milling machine backed  up and repositioned itself  the sweeper also backed up onto the north side of  the bridge. The second pass was approximately 6 feet 6 inches wide with the  overlap. While the milling machine was performing its second pass over the  bridge the trimming machine was operating in a south to north direction along  the far east side of the bridge where the milling machine conducted its first  pass over the bridge in order to mill the edge or the bridge near the concrete  retaining wall of the bridge. The sweeper followed the milling machine over  the bridge during the second pass over the bridge. The milling machine back up  and repositioned itself on the north side of the bridge to perform its third  pass over the bridge just west of the second pass. At this time the sweeper  machine was full of material and pulled farther north of the bridge to prepare  to dump into the dump truck that was positioned on the north side of the  bridge. While backing up the milling machine over the bridge to conduct the  fourth pass  the milling machine ground man located on the west side of the  milling machine was asked by Employee #1 if they needed the traffic cones  moved farther west slightly into the driving lane of the highway. The milling  machine ground man told Employee #1 not to move the traffic cones since they  were only going to complete a half pass. Employee #1 was located on the east  side of the machine and asked the milling machine operator if the traffic  cones should be moved. The milling machine operator also informed Employee #1  not to move the traffic cones. The milling machine operator and milling  machine ground man then continued to back the milling machine up approximately  another 50 feet to the north side of the bridge to the next dump truck in  line. %09 The Center Trucking vehicle was parked along the far east side of  the passing lane of Route 9 within the traffic pattern. The driver was out of  the vehicle but once the third dump truck left the site  the Center Trucking  driver looked around the truck  got back into the",

On the day of the accident   Employee #1 was using denatured alcohol to separate laminated glass. He had  been working at Sierra Glass and Mirror Inc for about eight years. He was  doing his regularly assigned work  and he had been working in this particular  work area for about 6 years. He was a manager. There were two stages to  separating the glass  and each stage consisted of pouring about 1.5 to 2  ounces of denatured alcohol onto the laminated glass. Employee #1 was working  on the second stage of separating the glass with denatured alcohol. It was  later determined that Employee #1 had not been formally trained on the health  and safety hazards of denatured alcohol  and any training he had received was  verbal or acquired through observation. Because denatured alcohol burned with  a clear flame  it was difficult to see if denatured alcohol had ignited.  Employee #1 had thought the first stage was done  and he had proceeded to the  second stage. At that point  he noticed a small flame on the can of denatured  alcohol that he was holding with his right hand. He tried to put out the  flames  but the can exploded in his right hand. The explosion caused injuries  to his right hand and the right-hand side of his torso. Employee #1 was  transported to Huntington Memorial Hospital and later transported to Los  Angeles County+USC Medical Center  where he had skin graft surgery to his  right upper arm and thorax  with skin that came from his right thigh. During  the investigation following the accident  the employer did not submit training  documents indicating that Employee #1 had been trained in the health and  safety hazards of chemicals  general safety of work  and so forth. Moreover   based on the lack of documentation  the conclusion was that Employee #1 was  not trained on how to safely work with denatured alcohol.",

        "text": "On June 7  2007  Employee #1  age 19  was part of a crew installing  reinforcing bars on the sides of a monopole cellular tower. Employee #1 was at  a height of approximately 108 ft installing rigging equipment so the  reinforcing materials could be hoisted to that level. When he climbed the  tower  his safety harness was connected to a cable lifeline that was equipped  with a cable sliding device. Once Employee #1 reached his working level  he  disconnected from the cable lifeline to reposition himself on the other side  of the tower. On the front of his safety harness  he had a pelican hook device  that was used for positioning. Employee #1 also had a safety lanyard that was  connected to the back of his safety harness. On the other end of the lanyard  there was a rope grab device  even though a rope lifeline had not yet been  installed on the tower. Employee #1 apparently connected the pelican hook to  the tower  as he was observed from the ground leaning back on his harness and  using both of his hands to move material. It is not known if the pelican hook  came loose when Employee #1 connected it to one of the climbing pegs on the  tower  or if he disconnected his hook to reposition himself. Employee #1 fell  from the tower  landing on the roof of a nearby building. He sustained  multiple fractures  lacerations and contusions to his head  neck  torso  and  extremities  and died at the work site. The medical examiner's report listed  the cause of death as multiple blunt force injuries. The report also stated  that Employee #1 had a high level of ethanol in his blood (0.13 percent) and  vitreous (0.16 percent)  as well as cannabinoids and nordiazepam. His  coworkers admitted that they had drank alcohol the previous night until around  midnight  but all denied that they drank or consumed drugs on the day of the  accident.",

        "text": "At approximately 10:00 a.m. on December 11  2013  Employee #1  a carpenter  foreman employed by Pacific Peninsula Group  was performing interior carpentry  at a residential construction site. He was using a Bosch 4000 stand-mounted  benchtop table saw with a 10-inch blade to cut wood pieces for framing  modifications. As he was making the first rip cut to a section of laminated  wood product measuring approximately 16 inches long by 1.75 inches wide by 4  inches high  his left hand contacted the blade. His left hand and fingers were  severely cut. Emergency services were called  and the Mountain View Fire  Department responded. Employee #1 was transported to Stanford Hospital  where  he was admitted and treated. His left middle finger  which had been completely  severed past the first knuckle near the palm  was surgically reattached. The  left ring finger  which was severed through the bone past the first knuckle   also was reattached  but during a return hospital visit this finger required  surgical amputation. This event was timely reported to Cal/OSHA by the  employer  and also reported by the Mountain View Fire Department. In its  subsequent investigation  Cal/OSHA identified the employer as a construction  management company performing as a general contractor for this residential  apartment building project  with tasks being performed by its own employees as  well as subcontractors. The task Employee #1 was performing required two rip  cuts to the section of laminated wood product to achieve the desired finished  piece  because the blade was capable of rising only to approximately 3 inches  high. Employee #1 was working alone  and no witness to the event was  identified. The guard for the Bosch 4000 included a hood  a splitter  and an  anti-kickback device combined as a single unit. This guard/hood was at the  site  but Employee #1 stated the guard was not installed on the saw at the  time he began to plan and perform his cuts. Employee #1 stated he set the rip  fence to the right of the blade at approximately 1.25 inches and had no other  anti-kickback attachments  separate from the guard/hood  available to install.  He also stated he did not install any featherboards or jigs to use as he made  cuts without the use of the guard/hood. Employee #1 stated he was pushing and  guiding the wood through the blade  with his right hand positioned at the end  of the wood length nearest to him  and his left hand positioned on the top and  at the end of the wood farther away from him. He stated there was no push  block or push stick at the saw  and he did not make one to use. He stated that  the first cut was almost complete  and the blade was about to come out at the  back side of the wood piece  when the wood kicked back and shot past his right  side. He stated his left hand was extended behind and over the saw blade  before the cut  but was pulled back partially by the kick-back  or his hand  movement may have been reflexive. The result was that his left hand contacted  the blade. The investigation report included a comment that the guard   anti-kickback  and spreader features of the Bosch 4000 were not separable.  They were designed to extend above and past the blade of the saw and would not  have allowed the uncut portion of the wood piece to have passed. The first cut  of the employee's two-step cutting plan was similar to a dado or cut where the  blade does not extend through the top of the wood. The report concluded that  the type of rip cut Employee #1 was making was allowable without use of the  blade's guard/hood only when additional protective devices  such as  featherboards  were being used and separate anti-kickback devices had been  installed. No protective devices  such as featherboards or anti-kickback  attachments  were available or installed on the table saw during the time when  the saw's guard/hood was not in place. No push sticks or push blocks were  available during the time when the table saw was being used.",

As Employee #1 went to reposition the saw and start a  new cut  with the saw blade stopped  he reached down with his left hand to  pull the bottom guard back so he could place the blade directly against the  wood. As Employee #1 did this  he inadvertently squeezed the trigger with his  right hand as he lifted up on the saw. The saw blade started spinning and  caused the saw to jump. As the saw jumped  the spinning blade struck Employee  #1's left pinky and amputated the tip.",

Emergency services were called  and  Employee #1 was transported to the hospital  where he was admitted and treated  for a fractured leg. The employer reported this injury to Cal/OSHA on  September 17  2013. The subsequent investigation determined that the employer  was a general engineering contractor involved in highway  street  and bridge  construction. Employee #1 was directly employed by the employer. The causal  factor in this event was that the anchor point used by Employee #1 was not  secure.

The hospital was undergoing renovations. The plastic sheet  was placed over the atrium to maintain negative pressure and prevent  construction dust from entering the nearby and connected VA Medical Center   which was an active location in the hospital. The open-air atrium measured  approximately 24 ft by 45 ft. Second floor and roof deck guardrails had  surrounded the top of the atrium  but had been demolished over the summer.  Additionally  DBI-Sala anchors that employees had used to demolish the  guardrail had been removed. After demolishing the guardrail  the top of the  atrium was enclosed by a locked construction fence. During a prejob meeting  that occurred at approximately 11:00 a.m. on October 11  2012  a crew attached  plastic poly sheeting under the existing sheeting drooping inside the  building. The crew used a scissor lift to attach this plastic to the inside  edge of a 2in by 4 ft wood frame around the atrium  instead of the second  floor and roof deck surrounding the edge of the atrium opening. Further  the  crew did not discuss what would be required for employees that access and work  from second floor and roof deck. Employee #1 and the coworker were instructed  to stay in the scissors lift and install the plastic from below. However  they  were not told that this was because no guardrails or approved fall protection  anchors were in the area around the atrium opening. When Employee #1  his  coworker and the rest of the crew were assembled to discuss the job  they  informed the foreman that the job could not be accomplished from below the  existing plastic using the scissors lifts. The foreman then directed the crew  to install the rolled poly plastic over the existing plastic and from the  second floor and roof deck. The foreman stated that he did not discuss or  receive permission for this change in the work procedure with the operations  manager. The site superintendent was also not aware of the change in the work  procedure. Further  the foreman and others had not been on the roof before the  work commenced. The foreman directed Employees #1 and a coworker to wear and  use fall protection. Employee #1 was wearing a Miller (Model Number E650) full  body harness with a Rebel Protecta 10 ft long retractable lanyard device  attached the harness. Employee #1 and the coworker pulled the plastic over the  open atrium  when Employee #1 fell. Even though Employee #1 was wearing fall  protection  his fall was not arrested due to the failure of the DBI-Sala  anchors. He fell approximately 20 ft from the roof atrium opening onto the  floor and was killed.",

They were moving a  sprinkler system up and down a large metal form that contained recently poured  cement. The cement  which was to increase the height and depth of the dam  had  solidified after being kept in the metal form  and the sprinkler system was  being used to prevent the cement face of the dam from cracking during the  curing process. Employees working on the face of the dam surface use their  harness and lanyard to tie off to specific areas of this metal form when  performing certain activities on the dam. The metal form has only one area to  which employees may tie off. It is called the strong back  is one of the  vertical ribs in the back section of this large metal form  and is an  anchorage point capable of withstanding at least 5 000 pounds for each  employee. Employees are prohibited from tying off to the metal shoes which are  attached to the front of the form by a carter pin. However  Employee #1 tied  off to the metal shoe when he was moving the sprinkler system. He fell  along  with the metal shoe  approximately 40 feet down stairs near the bottom of the  dam. Employee #1's lanyard was still attached to the metal shoe when he was  found after his fall at the bottom of the dam. Employee #1 sustained a left  ankle fracture. He was transported to a hospital and required surgery during  several days' hospitalization. Cal/OSHA Division was notified at 10:45 a.m. on  June 27  2012  and initiated its investigation at the employer's office in  Lakeside  CA at approximately 7:50 a.m. on July 10  2012.

The employer's work practices for safe ladder use  including tie-off  were in  place during the inspection of the job site. Employee #1 stated that the  intended location for his anchor point did not require him to lean to either  side of the ladder. Employee #1 indicated he had inspected the ladder prior to  use and that it was not damaged and was placed on a level surface. The  superintendent on duty stated that the ladder was inspected after the fall and  there was no observable damage.",

They were on the first floor and assigned to clean  a stack of plywood that had been stripped and removed from the upper floors.  On column B-5  there was a stack of laminated top MDO (medium density overlay)  plywood  each piece measuring 4 feet by 8 feet by 14.75 inches. The stack had  been piled (long side) vertically against the column by a forklift  with  Employee #2 helping to guide the load. As Employees #1 and #2 were removing  one sheet of plywood from the stack  the stack fell toward them. Employee #1  tried to push Employee #2 out of the way  but neither escaped in time to avoid  injury. They both fell onto the concrete slab underneath the plywood pile.  Nearby workers tried to lift up the pile and failed. Single sheets had to be  removed from the pile  one at a time. Emergency services were called  and the  San Francisco Fire Department responded. Employee #1 was transported to Kaiser  Hospital in San Francisco. He was treated and released the same day. Employee  #1 subsequently returned to the hospital for further treatment for a shattered  right heel  fractured toes  and a fractured ankle. He was hospitalized for 8  days and underwent two surgeries where rods and bolts were implanted into his  right foot and toes. Employee #2 was transported to San Francisco General  Hospital. He was treated for a bruised neck  shoulder  ribs  arm  foot  and  side. He was released the same day. This incident was reported to Cal/OSHA by  the San Francisco Fire Department on August 19  2013. Cal/OSHA sent an  investigator to the job site on August 19  2013  to begin the investigation.  It was determined that there were no witnesses to the incident. The foreman  was on another floor of the building. Interviews were conducted with Employees  #1 and #2  the project superintendent  the foreman  the field safety manager   the forklift operator  and the general contractor's management staff. It was  determined that the stack of plywood had not been secured. The foreman stated  that the plywood had a laminated top MDO (medium density overlay) and each  sheet weighed approximately 45 pounds. The total weight of 13 pieces of  plywood would have been just under 600 pounds. T8 CCR 1549(d) requires piles  of plywood stacked on edge to be positively secured to prevent tipping or  falling. The employer was cited one serious accident-related violation of this  regulation. The employer also was cited for failure to report to Cal/OSHA  Employee #1's 8-day hospital stay. The investigator observed other violations   and the employer was cited accordingly.",

Employee #1 was attempting to  remove and replace a broken tooth on the digging bucket at the maintenance  yard for the Schuyler Helm Bridge replacement project. Employee #1 was  performing repair on the Shanks clamp pocket by using air arc to cut old metal  off to put on a new pocket. Prior to this task  Employee #1 had worked on a  hydraulic valve at different location  about a five- minute drive from the  construction site. After the hydraulic valve task was completed  Employee #1  did not put the flammable solvent-Tech Brake Parts Cleaner- bucket away before  starting the cutting  grinding  and welding task. Employee #1 kept the plastic  bucket and some dirty rags at the work-bench on the back of the truck. The  work-bench was about 3 ft. above the ground and 10 ft. away from the cutting  area. The grinding and cutting area was about 5 ft. above the ground. While  Employee #1 was using an air arc to cut the old metal off the pocket  some  sparks caught rags on fire behind the truck. Employee #1 pulled the rags  underneath the bucket to put down the fire. The solvent splashed on his upper  body and caught him on fire. Employee #1 suffered second and third degree  burns to 40-percent of his upper body. Employee #1 was transported to St. Mary  Long Beach Hospital and later was transferred to UCLA Burn Center  where he  was hospitalized and treated for three and a half weeks.",

As part of the project  the crew reinforced the existing structures and  installed the fiber-optic cable. To install the cable  the crew would hang  sheaves  use a pulling rope to pull the cable through the sheaves  and  permanently attach the cable to the structure. The employees would reinforce  the existing structures by replacing some poles  installing additional cross  braces below the power line  and installing supporting braces above the  crossarm. The employees worked with the power line energized some of the time  and deenergized at other times. The employer relied on employee work practices  to avoid violating the minimum approach distance when the line was energized.  However  because of the placement of the braces and fiber-optic cable   maintaining the minimum approach distance was not possible on most structures.  One of the employees was completing the task of clipping in the fiber-optic  cable on a two-pole structure while the power line was energized. The employee  was attaching the cable to the structure with a housing that included a rubber  boot and reinforcing rods. As the employee was wrapping the rods around the  cable  one of the rods got stuck. When he jerked on the 1.8-meter-long rod to  free it  it passed too close to the power line  and current arced to the rod.  The employee was electrocuted and set on fire by the electric arc. His  coworkers conducted pole-top rescue  lowered him to the ground  and  administered cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. Their efforts were to no avail as  the injured employee was pronounced dead at the scene.",

The  employee worked directly for the employer at the site. He was using a ripsaw  to shorten pieces of lumber for the face frame of a cabinet. He was leaning  against some moving lumber to help guide it through a self-feeding circular  ripsaw. He was on the west side of the ripsaw  leaning on the north side of  the lumber that was against the fence where the stock was fed into the  equipment. The equipment being used was a Northtech Model Number NT-SL2000XL  industrial ripsaw  with Serial Number 0828003. Because the employee was  leaning against the moving stock  he did not observe a splinter on the lumber.  The splinter punctured the inner side of his left thigh for approximately 2  inches (50 millimeters)  injuring his femoral vein. He was in the hospital for  three days. The incident was reported by the employer to the Bakersfield  District office at 3:12 p.m. that same day.",

Later that evening  Employee #1 went to the hospital  complaining of pain and swelling in his left leg. He was admitted  and surgery  was performed to correct bleeding and a tear in his left superficial femoral  artery. Employee #1 remained hospitalized due to the formation of blood clots  in his legs and lungs. On January 2  2013  Employee #1 suffered a cardiac  arrest  likely due to the pulmonary clotting  and died.",

The  demolition involved the removal of tile flooring and paneling attached to  light soffits. Approximately 8 inches away from the paneling was surfacing  material on the soffits. Boeing had identified the surfacing material during  prior surveys as asbestos-containing. In the Scope of Work Specifications for  this project  all sprayed acoustical ceiling surfaces were assumed to contain  asbestos. This Scope of Work was provided to the contractors. When the  paneling was removed by the demolition employees  oversprayed surfacing  material was found behind the paneling. At that point  the job was shut down  and an asbestos abatement company was hired to abate and clean-up the project.  The employees involved in the incident were sent to a physician for a physical  examination. None of the employees involved in the incident were hospitalized.  An accident investigation revealed that the demolition contractor failed to  provide asbestos awareness training to its employees. A possible asbestos  exposure might have occurred.",

He helped his crew prepare the  containment area and check their personal protective equipment. The crew made  their entry into the containment area at approximately midnight. Seven workers  used three scissor lifts to access the ceiling where asbestos removal work was  to take place. One worker would wet down the asbestos-containing ceiling  drywall boards while the other six used chisels and hammers to break down the  ceiling material. The employees performing the removal left the lift platforms  and climbed onto the ceiling framework to break down the material. The lift  being used by Employee #1 was moved out of the way to allow the material being  broken to fall directly onto the floor. The supervisor and the remaining 6  workers were at floor level sweeping up and bagging the fallen debris. The  workers performing the breakdown crawled along the wood framework  made of  2-inch by 4-inch wood members  to access adjacent ceiling boards. The  structural member on which Employee #1 was located broke  causing him to fall  19 feet to the concrete floor. The employer had not provided the employees  with fall protection. Employee #1 died from head trauma and multiple fractures  throughout his body shortly after he fell.",

They moved  the scaffold to another location. When Employee #1 climbed back up the  scaffold  he grabbed the third level brace that was sitting on top of the  scaffold. The unsecured section of the scaffold slid toward Employee #1 and he  lost his balance and fell from the side of the tower. Employee #1 was not  trained on the erection and dismantling of the scaffold  and the erection and  dismantling of the scaffold was not performed under the supervision and  direction of a qualified person. Employee #1 sustained a head injury and was  transported to the hospital and admitted into the intensive care unit with a  diagnosis of a \"closed head injury\".",

In the process of evacuating the area  many of the employees  inhaled the fly ash  which caused lung irritations. The accident resulted in  nine employees being transported to local area hospitals  with three employees  being admitted for observation and further treatment. A review and  investigation of the work area determined that the controls for the damper  were not identified and isolated to prevent inadvertent operation.",

He was  working with a coworker and an independent contractor and was repairing the  asphalt pavement. The truck reportedly was parked on a pathway near the top of  a small hill that connected the track and field area to the main campus of the  school  where they were working. The driver of the truck reported that he:  parked the truck; set the brake; exited the vehicle; and  was at the rear of  the truck  where the group of workers was repairing the asphalt pavement.  Then  the truck began to roll backwards down the hill. Employee #1 was unable  to get out of the path of the truck and was struck by the vehicle. All of the  witnesses reported that Employee #1 was obviously dead from the injuries he  sustained. Based upon the evidence gathered during the investigation  the  employer did not ensure that the vehicle was under positive control at all  times  by ensuring that the parking brake was set and the wheels were chocked  or otherwise effectively prevented from movement by effective mechanical  means.",

The dumping area was  located approximately 2 000 feet away on Fire Department property. The  employee stood on the operating platform of the power buggy and drove the  buggy approximately 500 feet on a public county roadway. The buggy nose-dived  and catapulted the employee approximately 10 feet in the air. The employee  landed in the asphalt culvert along the right side of the roadway  in front of  the Fire Department. Fire Department personnel witnessed and responded to the  event. The employee was flown by Life Flight to a hospital shock trauma  facility. He was hospitalized and treated for head trauma  lacerations to the  scalp that required five stitches  and a torn tendon in his left knee that  required surgery. Investigation determined that the power buggy was operated  on a 6-degree slope on a public county road  whereas the operator's manual did  not permit the buggy to be driven on public roadways. The manual specified a  maximum buggy speed of 7 mph  and the operator was traveling at approximately  5 mph. The operator was hauling large rocks  an activity not permitted by the  buggy manufacturer. The operator's manual states that the buggy is intended to  haul only free-flowing material. The employee was not trained in the safe  operation of the power buggy.",

Pioneer Contractors Inc.  had a written contract  with the general contractor to install approximately 17 000 square feet of  built-up type roofing system on the Central Utility Plant Building of the  Kaiser Hospital project. Employee #1 was transferring molten roofing tar from  a pitch kettle to a metal five-gallon tar bucket. The bottom of the tar bucket  became stuck to the roof. As Employee #1 attempted to work the tar bucket  loose from the roof  some of the molten tar spilled over to the top of the tar  bucket and down into Employee #1's glove. Employee #1 received serious burn  injuries to his right wrist and hand in the event. Employee #1 was initially  taken to Kaiser Hospital in Oakland  California for treatment of his injury  and then transferred to St. Francis Hospital in San Francisco  California for  further treatment. Employee #1 sustained serious burns to his right hand and  wrist that required more than 24 hours of hospitalization. Based upon the  documentary evidence gathered during the investigation  it was concluded that  the personal protective equipment did not eliminate  preclude or mitigate the  hazard of molten roofing tar spilling down Employee #1's glove. This resulted  in serious burns to his wrist and hand. The employer was a roofing contractor  with approximately 13 years of experience and with eight employees on the  job-site. Employee #1 was not a manager or supervisor and was working within  his trade and at the task assigned to him.",

The two workers were  operating excavators to demolish columns and bays and drop them to the ground.  On the previous day  they had left an overhang of concrete from three bays. On  the morning of September 10  2013  Coworker #1 continued to demolish columns  while Employee #1 used his excavator to break up concrete on the ground.  Coworker #1 used his excavator to pull down a column. The overhanging concrete  fell to the ground  crushing Employee #1 and killing him. This fatality was  investigated by Minnesota OSHA. At the time of this report  MNOSHA had  proposed three serious citations for the employer and no citations for the  general contractor.",

According to the subsequent investigation   Employee #1 apparently was in an unsupported 14-foot 8-inch deep trench and  using a probe to locate the sewer line. The trench wall collapsed on top of  Employee #1. Emergency services were called. Fairfax County Fire & Rescue  responded and found only the victim's left hand exposed above the soil  surface. The officer in charge evaluated the scene  pronounced that Employee  #1 was dead  and determined that it was now a recovery operation. The Fairfax  County Fire & Rescue Department utilized the Technical Rescue Team to recover  the victim. Employee #1 was recovered from the trench collapse at 5:15 p.m. on  August 20  2013.",

The beams in the  structure have waists cut into their end points for stress relief that the  workers refer to as \"dog bones\". Because they are narrower at this point the  beam clamps can slide off them. This is what happened when Employee #1 lost  his balance. The clamp came off  and as he fell he first grabbed onto the beam  to slow his descent. He landed  feet first  and was transported to the  hospital as a precautionary measure. Employee #1 suffered minor contusions and  was released after approximately 4 hours. After the accident  the employer  decided to use chokers in place of beam clamps.",

The K-rail also had two 4 in. diameter  lifting holes located 12 in. from the top and 3 ft 9 in. from each end.They  were using approximately 41 lb C-shaped K-rail hooks manufactured by Don De  Cristo Concrete Accessories  Code KRHOOK  to pick up and move the K-rails. The  approximately 22 in. by 16 in. by 3/4 in. thick hooks easily slid under the  K-rail's 2 in. high scupper holes. At the time of the accident  the load had  reached its destination and was placed on the ground. Employee #1 removed the  hooks from the K-rail lifting holes and they dropped to the ground between the  forklift and the K-rail. The coworker was not aware that the left hook had  become wedged under the left scupper  and he boomed up and moved the forklift  back. This caused the K-rail to flip over in the direction where Employee #1  was standing. The left corner of the K-rail crushed his left leg below the  knee. He was transported to Loma Linda University Medical Center  where he was  hospitalized for two weeks.",

He fell to the ground  landing on his  back and head. He was flown by helicopter to a medical center where he  remained in a coma until his death thirteen days later.",

He was operating an Asplundh aerial lift   model L45  that was attached to a 1974 Ford flatbed truck. Employee #1 was in  the lift's bucket preparing to attach a 6 ft long by 3/4 in. thick wire rope  cable to one of the wooden poles. The other end of the cable was attached with  a D-ring to the front of the aerial lift's boom. Employee #1 was using the  boom to attempt to pull the pole from the ground. As weight was applied to the  D-ring  it failed and broke loose from the boom. This caused the boom and  basket to lurch  ejecting Employee #1. He was able to hang on momentarily to  the side of the bucket  but then he fell 18 to 20 ft to the ground and was  killed. Subsequent investigation found that the pole being pulled was actually  buried about 4 ft deep. The employer did not have an operator's manual for  this aerial lift  and neither did the manufacturer. In fact  the manufacturer  stated that the model L45 was manufactured in the 1960s and should have been  removed from service years ago. Employee #1 was not using any form of fall  protection at the time of the accident.",

Employee #1 accidentally placed the ground  prong into the energized plug receptacle and grounded out  causing the  third-phase fuse to blow. He was electrocuted. The wiring and the Chicago  Pyle/National attachment plug were found to be very dilapidated and had not  been inspected or maintained. Because of the configuration of the plug  any of  the eight-prong male plugs could have been inadvertently placed in any of the  female receptacles  energizing the metal casing. Because of Employee #1's  medical condition and the fact that there were no electrical burns inside or  outside his body  the coroner considered ruling the cause of death as natural  causes/coronary disease. After continuity testing and destructive testing of  the evidence  the cause of death was ruled to be electrocution.",

He tried to correct the jam by pushing  some of the material down towards the auger. His arm became caught by the  tines  which feeds material into the auger. An electrician noticed Employee #1  yelling for help and immediately cut the electrical power to the machine.  Emergency services were contacted and Employee #1 was transported to the  hospital. He was hospitalized and treated for a puncture wound to his forearm.  The machine did not have a point of contact guarded  which would have kept any  of his body parts from coming in contact with the augers in the hopper during  the operation cycle.",

There were no advance traffic warning  signs or cone tapers  in place  to warn motorists of the shoulder closure  and  no effort was made to divert traffic away from the shoulder closure  per MUTCD  requirements. In addition  there was no shadow vehicle  equipped with a  vehicle mounted impact attenuator  parked behind their work truck. Employee #1  and Employee #2 were standing on the shoulder at the rear of the work truck   with Employee #2  standing at the rear of the work truck  holding the base of  the sign post. Suddenly  a motorist struck Employee #2  throwing him  approximately 40 ft onto an earthen embankment  before striking Employee #1.  Employee #1 was crushed to death between the rear of his work truck and the  front bumper of the motorist's car. According to Maryland State Police  the  driver was adjusting her driver's side mirror  which had been knocked loose by  a mechanical brush at a carwash a short while before this incident occurred.  Employee #2 was treated for musculoskeletal injuries in the emergency room  at  the University of MD  Shock Trauma Center and released the same day.",

However  after lifting up the first metal  plate  the employees realized that load was not as stable as it should be.  Therefore  the coworker told Employee #1 to extend the outriggers of the crane  and set up wood cribbing underneath the footing of the outriggers because the  crane-truck was parked on a slightly sloped area. Employee #1 had his back  towards the open trench while he was sitting on the ground and was setting up  the cribbing. Employee # 1 was about 4.5 ft away from the open trench while  cribbing. As he finished the cribbing and got up  he forgot about the open  trench behind him and took two to three steps backwards  falling into the  trench. He struck his back on a valve attached to the water pipes  which were  about 3 ft high above the trench surface. Employee #1 suffered serious  injuries to his spine  and he was hospitalized for approximately three days at  a medical center.",

At about 11:40 a.m.  he had stopped his carpentry work and gone to  move a Genie S-60 boom lift down the home's driveway to a lower area of the  property. He did this because the machine was scheduled to be picked up later  that day. The worker was riding in the boom basket as the lift went down the  paved driveway. The driveway had an approximately 20 percent grade. The boom  basket was in a fully lowered boom position. He had the machine running in its  forward direction  facing downhill  with the basket trailing. As he moved down  the hill  the machine began to gain speed. When he tried to stop the machine   it went into a skid. He then intentionally steered the machine into a tree in  order to bring it to a stop. When the machine hit the tree  it rolled over and  came to a rest across the driveway. The worker was not secured to the basket  by any means  but he physically held on to the basket railing as it hit the  ground beside the driveway. He was thrown into the guardrail  and he sustained  spinal injuries. His back strains and sprains required treatment and  hospitalization of over 24 hours. The injured employee's supervisor was onsite  but not in the immediate vicinity at the time of the accident. At  approximately 3:45 p.m. on December 19  2011  the Santa Rosa district office  of Cal/OSHA received timely notification by the employer.

Employee # 2 operated  the telehandler  to raise the door up off the floor to the upright position.  The door was at an angle of approximately 75 degrees  when Employee # 1  grabbed a broom and began to sweep underneath the door. The strap slid off the  fork of the telehandler and struck Employee # 1 on his lower back. Employee #  1 fell to the ground in extreme pain.

He was lifting one end by himself because there was only a small  amount of wall studs to lift it onto. The other employees lifted the other end  of the wall where there were more wall studs to grab. When the other employees  lifted their end  the end opposite of the employee  the weight of the wall  shifted towards the employee and he experienced back pain. Employee #1 was  hospitalized for six days for his back injury.",

Employee #1 used insulated pliers and a 12-ft  non- conductive   fiberglass ladder manufactured by Werner (model number was NXT A12) with a  load capacity of 300 pounds. The light fixtures were located approximately (12  ft and 10 in.) from the floor. Employee #1 removed a light bulb and cut wires  while he was standing on the ladder. Employee #1 grabbed the top of a light  fixture with his left hand and was trying to remove a bolt with pliers  when  he felt an electric shock. This caused Employee #1 to fall from the ladder and  he landed on the concrete floor below. Employee #1 sustained hip fracture and  scalp laceration in the event. A primary root cause to this incident was due  to electrical equipment not being de-energized before servicing light  fixtures.

His chest apparently touched the metal flashing while his left hand was  apparently in contact with the casing of an electrical fluorescent store front  sign located on unit #1  about 12 in. below the roof. Employee #1 was  electrocuted. His coworker initiated CPR and told another coworker to call  911. Paramedics responded and continued CPR while transporting Employee #1 to  Pacific Hospital in Sun Valley  CA  where additional life saving efforts were  performed. Employee #1 was pronounced dead at 9:26 a.m. The cause of death was  listed as \"cardio/pulmonary arrest/electrical burn\" from electrocution.  Subsequent investigation revealed that the sign was not properly grounded and  there was a failure in the ballast  which allowed the casing of the sign to be  energized with 530-volt of current.",

According to Employee #1  the  supervisor did not inform him that there was a floor opening in that work  place vicinity  nor did he inform him to wear fall protection. The barricades  railing did not go all the way around. The employee stated that only two sides  of the floor opening were barricaded instead of all four sides. The employer  stated that the accident scene was not disturbed and preserved until CSHO  arrived. There was no evidence that two other railings were installed to guard  the two remaining openly exposed sides of the floor opening. Employee # 1  worked alone as he commenced to remove the railings. As he removed his first  railing  he stepped into a piece of plywood that tilted on to a floor opening.  A grey plastic sheet that concealed the floor opening covered the floor  opening. Employee #1 slid on the plywood and fell through the floor opening  breaking the grey plastic and falling to the first floor approximately 15 to  20-ft below.

Employee #1 arrived at the jobsite shortly before the accident to inspect  work performed  including the installation of drywall. He walked through the  ground floor of the residence  inspecting the drywall in the kitchen and  dining room before arriving at the elevator shaft where the accident occurred.  The elevator shaft had an opening in the wall of the main hallway that was  about 4 feet wide and 7 feet high. The open shaft way was guarded on the  ground floor by two guardrails. The bottom rail was secured to the wall by  nails at a height of approximately 12 and 24 inches  while the top rail was  secured with nails at a height of between 40 and 43 inches. Employee #1  climbed up onto the guardrails to gain a better vantage point to inspect.  Employee #1 placed his weight onto the guardrails  and the guardrails  separated from the wall.

Employee was on the trailer  a  coworker was on the ground  and a third coworker was operating a front loader  being used to lift the K-Rails. Six K-Rails were loaded per trailer. A cable  with loop was threaded through a lifting hole on each end of the K-Rail and  secured with a metal pin. After the last K-Rail was placed onto the trailer   Employee #1 removed a pin that secured the lifting cable closest to the middle  of the trailer and returned to the cable/pin closest to the rear of the  trailer. The loader operator saw Employee #1 remove the pin from the cable  closest to the rear of the trailer and pull the cable free of that lifting  hole. The loader operator believed he saw a signal to back-up  and he did so.  As the operator was backing up  Employee #1 jumped off the trailer and was  struck by the K-Rail  as it fell off the trailer. The job foreman called  emergency medical services and the West Sacramento Fire Department responded  and arranged transport to UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento. Crushing  injuries to Employee #1's right foot resulted in the amputation of three toes  and the partial amputation of a fourth toe. Employee #1 remained hospitalized  for two weeks. None of the employees could say what actually caused the K-Rail  to fall off the trailer.",

Employee #1 was threading  up a bundle of \"4\" (0.625 inch diameter) rebar through the MEP 85 V Rebar  Bending machine's (Serial Number 001028) (MEP 85V) rollers. The MEP 85 V bends  sections of rebar into different shapes (90-degree bends  rectangles  straight  pieces  etc.) and lengths that are used in construction trades for the  foundation of reinforced cement structures. Employee #1 was attempting to pull  the rebar through the first rollers of the MEP 85V but was having problems  so  a supervisor assisted him. The supervisor was spinning the large bundle (spool  of circular wrapped rebar on a dispenser) of rebar by hand during the rebar  threading process just before it enters the first set of rollers at the  entrance of MEP 85 V machine. Employee #1 was moving the rebar from the  prestraightening unit into the main straightening unit in between the first  two sets of rollers with his gloved right hand moving the rebar forward while  he had his left hand on the toggle switch. The first rollers (front driver  roller) on the straightening unit are responsible for grabbing and providing  the power to pull the rebar through the remaining rollers. A metal burr on the  rebar being fed into the first sets of upper and lower rollers got caught on  the edge of Employee #1's right gloved hand causing his right hand to be  pulled into the main straightening unit of the MEP 85V Rebar Bending machine  and crushing his two fingers (right ring and little finger). Employee #1  received sustained a complete amputation of the right ring and little finger  just above the second knuckle as a result of crushing his two fingers in the  front rollers. Once Employee #1 realized what he had done  he moved the toggle  switch using his left hand until the front driver roller went into the reverse  position to release his gloved right hand from the front driver roller. The  supervisor assisted Employee #1 to a manager's office to get help. Employee #1  told the manager that he didn't need a paramedic and had the manager drive him  to the hospital. The manager drove Employee #1 to Sharp Grossmont Hospital   where Employee #1 was hospitalized for three days. Employee #1 had two  surgeries on two different fingers as a result of his injuries. The right ring  finger was reattached. At the time of the interview with Employee #1 his ring  finger was getting sufficient blood supply and it was thought that it was  going to make a successful recovery.",

Employee #1 attempted to drag the  K-rail closer to the crane and then attempted to lift it  without the crane  outriggers being fully deployed. This action resulted in overloading the crane  and as a result  the crane tipped. A portion of the truck-mounted crane's  lighting system trapped Employee #1 between the K-rail and the truck mounted  crane. Employee #1 suffered a fracture pelvis  lacerated bladder and trauma to  the scrotum area. Employee #1 was hospitalized.",

They had a  permit confined space entry program. The company had been contracted to clean  coal tar tanks at a marine terminal. At the terminal  coal tar was pumped from  ocean-going tankers and imported into large atmospheric storage tanks. The  coal tar was then distributed via truck. They did not refine or change the  coal tar in any way. Employee #1 was working on a team with three coworkers  and the team was assigned the task of hydro-blasting tank #68  a tank  measuring approximately 30 feet by 30 feet. Employee #1 was using a  hydro-blasting wand  and all the safety features on the blasting gun were  functioning properly. It was fitted with two dead-man triggers  one for water  and the other for air pressure. Employee #1 was wearing metatarsal protection   but his protective boots had gotten wet earlier in the day and he took them  off. Employee #1 was wearing regular rubber boots while operating the  hydro-blaster. Employee #1 stepped over some pipes on the floor of the tank   and accidentally blasted the side of his left foot. The pressurized water cut  through the rubber material of the boot and severely lacerated his foot.  Employee #1 was sent to the emergency room for treatment and was kept  overnight. The wound became infected  and Employee #1 spent additional days in  the hospital for treatment. The employer provided all employees with full  metatarsal blasting boots and the employees were required to wear them. Each  employee was required to read and sign a statement acknowledging the need to  wear the special boots for all hydro-blasting operations. Employee #1 signed  the agreement. In addition to the written agreement  the company conducted  hands-on operating training with all new employees in a simulated waste tank   demonstrating the safe operation of hydro-blasting equipment. In addition  the  employer gave each worker a wallet-sized card describing the special medical  treatment procedures associated with water-jet injuries. A copy of the card  was given to the emergency room doctor treating Employee #1.",

The  rolling scaffold base area was 14 ft by 10 ft and the height was 30 ft. The  rolling scaffold had six swivel casters which helped the employees to position  the scaffold at different locations inside the tank. There was no  manufacturer's name for the scaffold. At one point of the sand blasting  operations  when the scaffold was pushed for repositioning purposes  one of  the six swivel casters became disengaged from the scaffold  resulting in  tipping and falling of the scaffold on the floor. Employee #1 and the coworker  who were working on the top scaffold platform  fell and were injured. The  coworker sustained head  chest  rib  and right ankle injury.

One of  them controlled the boom at the top of the building and had direct radio  communication with the man at the trailer  who operated the machine's switches  and controls. They had started work at approximately 9:00 a.m. Having  completed the pour  Employee #1 and the coworker blew out the hose and pipes  using air pressure and sponges  in accordance with cleaning procedures  and  were working together at ground level to finish washing and cleaning the  concrete pump hopper. Employee #1 reversed the hydraulic pump and dumped the  excess concrete into the waste bin. He then proceeded to wash the hopper with  the water hose. Seeing some sand still collected in the bottom of the hopper   he opened the hopper grate and reached inside with his left hand to scoop out  the small amount of sand. Inside the hopper was an S-valve and an agitator  tube. As Employee #1 reached down into the hopper  the S-tube cycled and  trapped his hand against the concrete delivery cylinder. The coworker had  momentarily turned away  but looked back at the hopper when he heard a bang.  He saw what had happened and operated the controls to reverse the S-tube and  release Employee #1's hand  which was nearly amputated. Subsequent  investigation determined that the machine was not turned off and deenergized  before Employee #1 reached into the hopper. Employee #1 had not received  training in lockout/tagout procedures. He did control the switches and later  stated that he believed that he had placed the pump in the OFF position as he  completed the cleaning task. The employer was cited for violations related to  lock-out/tag-out procedures.",

        "text": "On September 24  2007  Employee #1 and two coworkers were engaged in  installing water pumps and piping at a pump station. In this process  it was  necessary to vertically join together 10 ft long assemblies consisting of  three parts. The innermost part was a metal water pipe with an approximately  20 in. diameter. These assemblies weighed several hundred pounds and were  handled using an overhead hoist operated electrically by an operator with a  direct line of sight to the assembly crew. The stainless steel axle  when  fully assembled is driven by an overhead motor and is used to activate an  impeller that drives water vertically up the water pipe. The 7 in. metal axle  housing protects the axle and weighs approximately 200 lb per 10 ft section.  The outermost water pipe carries water upward to large pumps for  transportation through larger water lines. It has collars welded inside it  just large enough to allow the axle housing to be held firmly in place when  installed. At the time of the accident  the stainless steel axle had been  lowered and connected to the axle section below it. The operator was lowering  the axle housing to be threaded into the coupling on the housing section below  it when the axle housing section became caught on a collar inside the  outermost water pipe. This resulted in some slack in the hoist chain that was  not visible inside the water pipe. Not seeing the next section of the axle  housing  Employee #1 put his hand into the water pipe to locate the axle  housing  thinking it was secured by the hoist. At that instant  the axle  housing slid through the water pipe collar  catching Employee #1's thumb  between the edge of the falling axle housing and the axle housing coupling  below. His thumb was partially amputated and he was transported to the  hospital for treatment.",

A forklift had been situated to catch and  prevent slabs from falling  but in this instance the slabs broke along the  fork line. Those portions not stopped by the forklift fell onto Employee #1's  legs. Emergency services were called  and the local fire department responded.  Employee #1 was transported to the hospital  where he was admitted and treated  for fractures of both lower legs. Employee #1 required hospitalization for  more than one week. The local fire department notified Cal/OSHA of this event  on December 13  2013. The subsequent investigation established that the  employer was a manufacturer and installer of stone counter tops. Employee #1   a full-time worker performing general labor tasks  had three months of work  experience with the employer.",

Employee #2 was working as the driver of a CAT AP-1055D Track  Asphalt Paver  and was working in the vicinity of a dump truck that was  loading asphalt into the paver. There had been over 40 similar loads made that  day  all with the hitch arm assembly of the paver fully extended outward to  allow the truck bed to get in a clear position for the dump. A spotter had  also been present for all of these earlier loads  and the job of this spotter  was to assist the alignment of the paver and truck. On this particular dump   the paver's operator was not aware that he had laterally retracted the left  and right hitch arms at the front of the paver  moving the arms inward  while  the dump truck carrying asphalt was backing up to offload asphalt into the  paver's hopper. The spotter was also absent during this particular dump. The  dump truck pulled in at an angle and the paver's left hitch arm was embedded  between the outside and inside left rear tires on the rear axle of the dump  truck. Employee #2 then drove the paver forward for about 15 feet before  stopping with the hitch arm stuck in the rear tires. Employee #1 was called to  the scene of the accident and tried to determine a way of disengaging the two  vehicles. Employee #1 was standing between an adjacent roadway gate and within  three feet of the vehicles. There was a blowout of the inside right tire of  the dump truck. Employee #1 said he took one or two steps backward and was  unconscious for a time where he landed on the opposite side of the gate rail.  Employee #1 suffered initial bruising and concussive injuries to his ribs   head  neck and back and non-permanent facial dermal injuries from mixed flying  debris from the tire blowout. He was hospitalized for over 24 hours at  Stanford Hospital. The Division did not issue an accident-related citation  because no violation of Title 8 of the California Code of Regulations was  determined to have caused the accident. Operator error appeared to be a  primary factor in the incident. However  the operator had at least 3 years of  experience in that position. Employer stated there had never been a prior  instance of this particular sequence of events or results and has taken  effective steps to ensure or limit the chance of such reoccurrence. The  general contractor was not involved in any of the immediate events leading up  to the incident and had no knowledge of it while it was in progress. General  citations unrelated to the accident were issued to both employers for failure  to document all required heat illness prevention procedures in writing.",

They connected a 20 ft length of 3/8 in. air hose  to the compressor and began inflating the tire. Before starting  the flat tire  registered at 15 psi; normal pressure for the tire was 35-40 psi. Although the  air hose was equipped with a clip-on chuck  it did not have an inline pressure  gauge  so Employee #1 had to check the tire pressure periodically with a  handheld tire gauge. As the tire was inflating  the lock ring on the rim  assembly blew off the rim and struck Employee #1 in the head. He was  transported to the hospital  where he died two days later as a result of his  injuries.",

An unrelated company had used the scaffold to gain  access to all areas of the inside walls of the boiler to clean them. The  cleaning process produced a large amount of fine  dark-colored dust on  scaffold parts and working platforms. As the planks and frames of each level  of the scaffold had been removed  more of the dark-colored dust began to fill  the air and settle on the scaffold planks below. By the time all but a couple  of planks remained on the second to lowest tier  Employee #1 repositioned  himself on the lowest tier in order to reach up and remove the two planks  remaining above him. Since the lowest tier was protected by rails on the  outside and the wall of the boiler on the inside  Employee # 1 believed it was  no longer necessary to tie off. At this point in the operation  there was a  lot of activity on the lowest tier with workers moving toward the area where  scaffold parts were being handed down. There was also a lot of dust in the air  which diminished the available light. Employee #1 was walking on the platform  planks near the wall while moving to the drop-off point. Unknown to him   someone had removed two inside planks from that working platform and he fell  through the hole to the floor approximately 20 to 25 feet below. Employee #1  was hospitalized due to his fractures.",

An employee of a cleaning service entered the  boiler room at approximately 10:00 a.m. to get a ladder and observed that  Employee #1 was sweating profusely and the room was extremely warm. At 11:00  a.m. an employee of the building management company tried to reach the victim  by phone and did not receive a response. Between 11:30 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. on  December 5  2008  the victim's supervisor arrived at the site (also  after  trying to reach him by phone) and found the door to the boiler room locked. At  approximately 12:00 p.m. Employee #1 was found unresponsive in a boiler room  of a condominium complex. Employee #1's supervisor reported that one of the  three comfort heating boilers was operating. When the supervisor obtained the  key to the room  he found Employee #1 sitting on the floor leaning against a  box unconscious. Employee #1 was pronounced dead at 12:25 p.m. at the scene.  The medical examiner called the fire department and requested that carbon  monoxide measurements be taken in the boiler room. The fire department  measured approximately 1 400 parts-per-million of carbon monoxide in the room.  Exhaust dampers on two of the comfort heating boilers were observed by the  contractor to be partially closed during troubleshooting following the  accident. This included the damper on the boiler that was operating when  Employee #1's supervisor entered the boiler room. Following an autopsy  the  medical examiner declared Employee #1 died of carbon monoxide intoxication.",

The bar joists were bolted  in position and supported by post shores  one on each end. The original bar  joists had been removed  sand-blasted  primed  and set back in place. There  were two 2-feet by 4-feet joists nailed diagonally on each of three sides of  the carport to provide lateral support. The crew started work at the front of  the carport and removed the post shores and the two aluminum beams   transferring the weight from the aluminum beams to the open-web steel bar  joists  which were bolted in position and had one post shore at each end for  support. The top ends of the post shores were bolted to the bar joist and the  bottom ends nailed to the concrete slab. None of the single post shores had  bracing of any kind. There was one new steel support post on each end of the  open-web steel bar joist. The new steel support posts were bolted at the top  only. The bottom was left hanging in order to judge where the concrete needed  to be placed. As the crew moved to the middle of the carport to begin removing  the temporary aluminum beams and post shores holding the aluminum beams in  place  Employee #1 and one of the coworkers were turning the screws down on  the post shores. The roof started to shift to the left side and forward   causing the roof to collapse. Employee #1 was trapped in the middle under the  beams and later died. The coworker  also under the collapsed roof  fell near a  pile of concrete rubble  which kept the roof from crushing him. The coworker  sustained minor injuries.",

At  one point  the vapors from the highly flammable bonding agent ignited in the  area where Employee #1 was working.

Six to eight of the empty bonding agent containers were left uncovered  which  allowed vapors to escape that contributed to the main cause of the fire. The  ambient temperature was in the high 90s F  and the humidity was high. The  material safety data sheet and the buckets' labels clearly stated that all  containers were to be covered while not in use and that vapors from the  bonding agent could be readily ignited by static electricity.",

According to the  subsequent investigation report  Employee #1  a heavy equipment mechanic   Coworker #1  also a heavy equipment mechanic  and Coworker #2  a crane  operator  had been assigned to re-spool the steel cable of a 15-ton crane  a  National Crane Company Series 500C Boom Truck with 180-foot cable  .625-inch  in diameter. Employee #1 was assigned as the Lead and was overseeing the  re-spooling. He and Coworker #1 were working at the boom level  and Coworker  #2 was operating the controls based on Employee #1's direction. Employee #1  was standing on a ledge to the right side of the boom  approximately 8 feet 4  inches above the ground. Employee #1 and Coworker #1 both were working at the  boom level without fall protection. Coworker #1 said he safely held onto a  fixed part of the crane to prevent himself from falling. Employee #1 said  there was no handhold where he was standing  so he securely grasped the top of  the boom cover  a fixed structure  by placing the fingers of his left hand  inside the holes as he guided the steel cable with his right hand  on which he  wore a wire glove. According to the employer's Safety Director  Employee #1   while spooling the first layer  needed to hold the cable and tap it with a  hammer to ensure the cable was wrapped tight and close together. The three  employees were almost finished re-spooling the cable  and Coworker #1 was  already on the ground  when Employee #1  still standing at the boom level   directed Coworker #2 to retract the boom  not realizing that his left hand  fingers were still inside the holes of the boom cover. Employee #1's index  finger was pinched between the boom cover and the boom's anti-friction pads   resulting in an amputation. Employee #1 was transported to the hospital  where  he was admitted and treated for amputation of the left hand index finger.  Following its investigation  Cal/OSHA issued two Serious citations  alleging  violations of: Title 8 of the California Code of Regulations (T8 CCR)  section  3210 (b)  for Employer's failure to protect its employee(s) from exposure to  fall of approximately 8 feet 4 inches  while working on the Series 500 C boom  truck cable  by means of fall protection  including but not limited to:  handholds; fall arrest systems; and/or guardrails; and T8 CCR  section 3314  (g)  for Employer's failure to provide and require the use of extension tools  (e.g.  extended swabs  brushes  scrapers) or other methods or means to protect  its employees from injury while re-spooling the cable of the Series 500 C Boom  Truck; employee #1 was using his hand to guide the cable during re-spooling.  Cal/OSHA also issued two General citations for Employer's failure to: complete  and/or document a pre-task report prior to assigning its employees to re-spool  the Series 500 C Boom Truck's cable  as specified in its written Injury and  Illness Prevention Program  a violation of T8 CCR  section 3203 (a); and  include in its Hazardous Energy Control Procedures the following  including  but not limited to: scope; purpose; authorization; rules; techniques to be  utilized for the control of hazardous energy; the means to enforce compliance;  and separate procedural steps for the safe lockout/tagout of each machinery or  equipment  as required  a violation of T8 CCR  section 3314 (g).",

These light poles  which had  been bolted onto the side of the bridge  had broken off and fallen into the  roadway after being struck during an accident earlier in the day. The weather  was warm and clear  with a temperature of 81 degrees. The work crew started  removing the poles at approximately 2:00 p.m.  after the police blocked off  the section of the road they were working in. They had three poles to remove  from this location. They used a 2012 Freightliner with a 2012 Altec Digger  Derrick work body  South Carolina license plate number P728016  48' boom  extended  FMCSA inspected December 2012  Equipment Number 5154  USDOT 278298.  The boom of the Digger Derrick was used to pull the damaged poles up and place  them on the rack of the truck. Employee #1  when subsequently interviewed   stated that he had been trained to always secure the boom by lowering it  completely down to the auger stow bracket before moving the truck. However  on  this occasion he left the boom elevated to approximately 5 feet  at unknown  length of extension  so that Coworkers #3 and #4 could strap the poles down in  the rack. Employee #1 said that he could not remember why he did not make sure  that the boom was secured and resting in the auger stow bracket before getting  off the operating station. Employee #1 said that all of the training he had  received had taught him to make sure the boom was secured before moving the  truck. Employee #1 and Employee #2 were in the Digger Derrick truck  Coworker  #1 was in a bucket truck  Coworker #2 was in another bucket truck  and  Coworker #3 was in a pickup truck. They all began to proceed off the bridge   travelling at a speed of approximately 30 MPH. Suddenly the boom on the Digger  Derrick truck rose up and struck the Meeting Street sign  which was 15 to 18  feet directly above the roadway and measured approximately 18 feet long by 3  feet high. The boom straightened out  and the front of the Digger Derrick  truck reared up. The Digger Derrick truck fell on its right (passenger) side  and slid 30 to 40 feet down the side of the bridge. Then the boom swung around  to the right and pulled the Digger Derrick truck off of the bridge. The Digger  Derrick truck came down on its rear and fell 30 feet to the ground below on  its left (driver) side. Coworkers #1  #2  and #3 stopped their trucks and  looked over the bridge rail. Coworker #1 saw movement in the truck and phoned  for emergency services. Then the three coworkers made their way down to the  accident site. When they arrived  the police and emergency medical service  were onsite  and the coworkers were unable to approach the truck. Employees #1  and #2 were transported to the hospital  admitted  and treated. The initial  report on injuries indicated that Employee # 1 had two fractured ribs and  fluid in his chest as well as a chipped bone in his shoulder. Employee #2 had  cuts and bruises to his face  and strains and bruises to his back  shoulder   and leg. Both employees required extensive surgeries and  at the time of this  report  had not returned to work.",

        "text": "On December 6  2006  a three-person crew  consisting of Employee #1  who was a  lineman  a foreman/groundsman  and a traffic control flagman  was removing  communication lines and poles as part of a road-widening project in Visalia   CA. The main line ran east/west  with the subject white pole (\"P1/gas  treated\") located at the west side of an intersection  where it received a  \"T-line\" from the north. A guy was provided at mid-pole height opposite the  \"T-line\". The wrecking operation had proceeded from the west to the subject  pole. The foreman supported the conductor with a rope for lowering  while  Employee #1  who was elevated in a manbucket on the north side of the pole   released the conductor/strand hanger. Just after the hanger was released  the  pole failed at a point between 18 inches and 24 inches above the guy attaching  point. The \"T-line\" caused the line bearing the weight of the pole to pin  Employee #1 against the bucket and render him unconscious. The foreman called  emergency medical services and attempted to lower and move the aerial device   which had become caught because of the lateral load. He then went to retrieve  a digger with the capacity to lift the line  but before he returned  Employee  #1 had regained consciousness and cut the strand. This released the lateral  force and caused the boom to rebound and eject Employee #1 from the bucket.  His personal fall arrest system prevented further injury. Employee #1 was  transported to the hospital  where he was admitted for cervical and lumbar  spinal fractures. The subsequent investigation determined that the root cause  of the accident was a hidden defect in the utility pole  which was guyed and  appeared to be structurally sound. Because employees were not required to  climb the pole  inspection and \"Butt\" testing was not required. Inspection  procedures would have required a visual appraisal  in addition to driving  nails  and sounding of the pole at the first 2 feet above the ground.  Employees demonstrated knowledge of safe procedures and of the hazards  pertaining to wrecking operations. The employer had a well-devised and  implemented safety and health program.",

Employee #1 was just starting to lower the lower  boom of the Hi-Ranger when the boom of the Manitowoc began to swing at a high  speed to the right. The coworker grabbed the controller but it would not stop.  The Manitowoc boom swung so fast that it put enough tension on the bucket  truck boom to break the hold-back cable and continued to push the upper boom  over. This released the leveling cables on the Hi-Ranger bucket truck and  caused it to flip over  throwing Employee #1 out of the cab. He fell to the  ground and sustained fatal head injuries. When the remote controls were later  tested  the remote START button was hit and the swing controller actuator  pulled the swing lever full right. When the emergency STOP button was hit  it  would kick out of neutral  but when it was pulled on again the swing lever  went to full swing right. There was apparently a malfunction with the  controller. Further evaluation showed that the servo-actuator had also  malfunctioned.",

Employee #1 was standing  in a 34 in. wide opening that was approximately 3 1/2 ft between the boom line  and whip line spools and a metal guard/shield. The shield was an integral  but  not a structural  part of the machine and it was intended to guard against  workers falling into the rotating auxiliary shaft and clutch during normal  maintenance of the crane. The whip line spool and boom line spool were on a  common horizontal axis  but rotated independently. The lines ran over the tops  of the spools  putting them slightly below Employee #1's head as they were  drawn from the horizontal boom. He guided the lines  as necessary  to yield an  even tight lay. By this point  the whip line had been secured and the boom  line was being spooled at 16 rpm. Employee #1 was standing on a metal floor  and apparently was astride the continuously rotating auxiliary 5 in. diameter  shaft. To one end of the shaft was attached a 27-in. diameter friction clutch   which operated the whip line spool and was open on the side closest to the  employee. Employee #1 had on a safety belt with a shoulder harness and  lanyard. It appears that Employee #1's clothing or lanyard became caught in  the rotating parts. The clutch continued to rotate approximately 3/4 turn  after Employee #1 alerted the operator that he was caught. He was pulled into  a 13 in. area and killed.",

        "text": "On June 11  2012  Employee #1  of Vegas Tunnel Constructors  Las Vegas  NV   was part of a swing shift crew excavating a tunnel. They were using a tunnel  boring machine (TBM). The TBM had been excavating in closed mode for  approximately 17 days. Closed mode is a term used to describe one of two modes  of operation this TBM was capable of performing  the other being open mode.  Closed mode excavation involves the pressurization of the cutterhead and face  of the TBM to support the ground and/or control excessive groundwater inflows.  The position of the TBM found it excavating through a large vertical fault  zone that later became the Detachment Fault. The ground conditions required  the TBM face to be pressurized to approximately 13 bars of pressure. The grout  being injected in the annular space was being pumped in at approximately 14  bars. The swing shift had begun work and was preparing to erect a ring segment  set; Ring #135. The swing shift began to build Ring #135 at about 4:00 p.m.  The first segment was successfully installed in the tunnel crown (top of the  tunnel). The crew then began to install the second segment  which was to be  placed in front of the keystone of Ring #134. Three hydraulic rams  including  one abutting the keystone of Ring #134  were slowly retracted. Almost as soon  as the retraction began  a loud pop was heard. Some members of the crew  reported hearing a second pop. The keystone for Ring #134 had shifted forward  approximately 4 inches. The come-a-long did not hold the forces exerted  and  the gears were stripped out. This shift permitted grout and other materials  such as rocks to escape the annulus at a pressure of approximately 14 bars  (200 psi). Employee #1 was standing in front of the area where the gap  developed. He was struck and killed by the moving grout and rocks. Coworkers  found Employee #1 and removed him from the tunnel.",

Also at the site were a  coworker  who was a drill operator  and a foreman. All three employees were  employed by a commercial contractor that specializes in street and traffic  light installations in Southern California. Employee #1 was a locator  who  walked on the ground surface to locate the underground directional drill head  using a detector unit to track the horizontal and angle movement of the drill  head. This information was communicated back to the coworker  who was the  operator seated on the directional boring machine (a Vermeer Number D24x40  Horizontal Directional Drill). The horizontal directional drill was used to  dig under cement  pavement  and earth to lay electrical lines for street and  traffic lights. The head of the drill first made a path through the soil  underneath the ground  until it arrived at its destination. A line was then  pulled through it  so electrical lines could be installed to hookup traffic  and signal lights for public streets and freeways. The front section of the  horizontal directional boring machine was outfitted with a left and right  anchor boring unit with stakes. The stakes were large auger units that tapped  into the ground vertically to stabilize the machine when its drilling rods  apparently ran horizontally  underneath the ground. The bolt holding the auger  bit to the shaft on the main frame of the directional boring machine came off   and the coworker had to take it apart to get to the dislodged bolt.  Apparently  the coworker tightened the bolt  got up on the directional boring  machine  seated himself  and unsuccessfully attempted to line up the square  piece fitting of the shaft over the top of the auger attachment. Employee #1  came over and used his left hand to try and line up the shaft  while the  coworker manipulated the controls  in an attempt to attach the shaft to the  auger bit. The shaft dropped on employee's #1 left thumb  causing the top one  inch to be amputated. The foreman transported Employee #1 to U.S. HealthWorks  First and later transported him to the Orthopedic Center in La Jolla. Employee  #1 was hospitalized and required outpatient surgery the day after the  accident. The Division was notified about the accident on May 18  2007. During  the initial investigation  Employee #1 had not yet returned to work  but the  Division found he had returned to work during a subsequent visit to another of  the employer's job sites on June 11  2007.",

During the operation  the boring bit on the machine needed to be  replaced. Employee #1 began rotating the boring rods  as Employee #2 stood on  the other side  holding the boring bit with a pipe wrench. The torque exceeded  the shear stresses on the bit  causing it to break and launching the pipe  wrench. The pipe wrench struck Employee #1  lacerating and fracturing his leg;  whereas  the boring bit ejected from the boring head  striking and knocking  Employee #2 to the ground. Employee #2 sustained internal contusions and a  left arm facture. Both employees were transported to a hospital. At the  medical center  Employee #1 underwent two surgical procedures to repair  lacerations and fractures to his leg  and Employee #2 received one surgical  procedure to stabilize fractures to his arm. Following the surgeries  both  employees were hospitalized for postoperative treatment. The cause of the  accident was the direct result of not adhering to standard operating  procedures.",

As the backhoe operator worked   his bucket uncovered a large 6 ft wide by 8 ft long by 3 ft deep rock. He lost  control of it  and the rock fell down the face of the south wall and became  wedged between the rock wall and one of the steel tubes.

The investigation determined that the employer did not have a  qualified person for scaffold erection and dismantling on site. On or before  May 9  2013  other employees had removed scaffold wire ties and braces that  had served as safety devices on a section of the scaffolding. As Employee #1  attempted to work from a 9-foot-high section of the scaffolding  the  scaffolding shifted  and Employee #1 jumped and fell 9 feet in an effort to  protect himself.

The bracing on  the shoring was on the high side of the hill. The excavation was over 5 feet  high per employees  as the shoring was above their heads with the dirt level  with it. As the employees dug  they threw the spoil on the high side. Since  the bracing was on the high side  the surcharge caused the hill to slide down   pushing the shoring on the high side forward and pinning Employee #1 between  that side and the opposite side shoring. The trench collapsed. Employee #1 was  killed in the accident. On the day of the accident  there was no competent  person on site. At approximately 2:30 p.m.  the Ventura County Fire Department  notified OSHA of the collapse. Observation of the scene disclosed poor shoring  construction techniques  poor quality wood  and surcharge on top of the hill.  Background: The employees had originally dug a ledge on a hill to place a  rebar cage for the foundation of a cinder block retaining wall. Three days  before the accident  the Ventura County Building and Safety Department  Inspector visited the site and informed the person in charge that the shoring  and excavation were not being done properly  there was surcharge  and the  whole site had to be engineered. He told the person in charge that the trench  had to be dug an additional 2 feet for footings.",

The carpenters  whose ages ranged from 24-57  were  working from tubular-welded frame scaffolding which was located at the second  floor level. With the majority of the new trusses in place  a loud noise was  heard and the trusses began collapsing along with the adjacent wall of the  structure. All three workers received multiple injuries as they were struck-by  and caught between falling truss members  masonry units and the scaffolds  themselves. Among the injuries sustained were: a foot fracture  nerve damage  to the hand and arm motor function  and numerous bruises and laceration. All  were transported to the emergency room  but none were hospitalized. Site  inspection revealed a number of deficiencies in the truss construction dealing  with stabilization  bracing and anchoring to the building's masonry walls.",

Based on a subsequent reconstruction of the  event  Employee #1 attempted to use an extension ladder to reach the upper  portion of a wall located above the living room stairwell  his intention being  to clean dust off the wall with a water-soaked sponge. The extension ladder  was extended to approximately 17 feet and was supported against the wall  with  its padded feet against the tile floor and the top of the ladder approximately  14 feet above the floor. The ladder was at an approximate angle of 59 degrees.  Evidence suggested that Employee #1 was climbing the ladder when the ladder  slid out from underneath him. The ladder appears to have slid vertically down  the wall and then horizontally down the stair railing  causing Employee #1 to  fall from an unknown height. He landed on his head and came to rest with his  left side facing south  lying longitudinal with his head to the east and his  feet to the west. Emergency services were called  and Employee #1 was rushed  to the hospital  where doctors pronounced him brain dead but technically  alive. According to the subsequent investigation report  the charge nurse on  duty stated that Employee #1 was given a one percent chance to survive. At  3:37 a.m. on December 8  2013  Employee #1 was pronounced dead from trauma to  the head that caused bleeding in the brain.",

        "text": "At approximately 10:05 a.m. on March 8  2013  Employee #1  a carpentry crew  leader employed by HAR Construction Co. LLC  was working at a construction  site where a new six-story apartment complex with two stories of underground  parking was being built. He was wearing a hard hat and had on his carpenter's  belt. He was walking on a wood platform on the fourth floor of the building  under construction. The platform measured 9 feet 11 inches long by 47.5 inches  wide and was not guarded on the north  south  and east sides. A gust of wind  or some other factor caused Employee #1 to fall from the platform. He fell to  a concrete floor area on the third floor below  a distance of approximately 10  feet 8.25 inches. He apparently did not strike or hit anything as he fell. He  landed between two 2-foot by 4-foot wood braces that were positioned 5 feet  1.25 inches apart on the third floor. He landed face down  striking his head  on the concrete floor approximately 4 feet 4 inches from a wood framed wall.  Employee #1's fall was witnessed by Coworker #1  who was working on the third  floor. Coworker #1 went to Employee #1 and got no response. He then went and  got help from one or more others at the work site. When they returned   Employee #1 was still unresponsive. There was a considerable amount of blood  pooled around Employee #1's head. Rescue personnel were called  and when they  arrived  they pronounced Employee #1 dead at the scene from massive head  trauma. The subsequent investigation established that Clark Builders Group LLC  was the general contractor for this work project. One of the subcontractors  was Agility Construction LLC  which had the framing contract. Agility  subcontracted all of the framing work to HAR Construction Co. LLC  with which  Agility had worked numerous times on other job sites. Agility's project  manager had responsibility for overseeing the labor (the HAR employees) and  the ordering and delivery of all the building materials. The project manager  for Agility did the majority of the lay out and mark up of the different units  on each floor. Agility dealt directly with the Clark Builders Group officials.  HAR Construction Co. LLC had 52 employees working at this site. They had been  at the site since early January 2013. There were two foremen  two crew  leaders  16 carpenters  and 32 skilled laborers. Their employees were working  all over the large project. Employee #1 had been one of the two carpentry crew  leaders. On other jobs he had been a foreman. He had worked for HAR  Construction Co. for 8 years. As a crew leader he checked on the four groups  of carpenters working throughout the project. He used a chalk line to lay out  where the walls were to be constructed. He also assisted in undoing the  rigging on the different loads of materials and equipment lifted up and onto  the different floor levels by the tower crane. Prior to his fall  Employee #1  was up on the fourth floor conducting various work duties. During the  investigation  Coworker #1 stated that he believed it was approximately 9:00  a.m. when Employee #1  while still up on the fourth floor  walked over near  the work area on the third floor where Coworker #1 was working. Coworker #1  told Employee #1 that they needed one more 2-foot by 4-foot piece of lumber  and that there were no more on the third floor. Employee #1 went back to an  area on the fourth floor that was enclosed by guardrails and picked up a piece  of lumber from a lumber stack. He then handed the lumber down to Coworker #1  from either inside or outside the guarded area. After Coworker #1 took the  lumber  Employee #1 told Coworker #1 he was going to come down to the third  floor using the job-made wood ladder that was at the east end of the platform  nearby. Within seconds Employee #1 fell from the south side of the fourth  floor platform to a concrete floor area on the third floor. All of the  building's floors were made of wood except this concrete section on t",

Two more employees were on the new concrete slab   cleaning up the removed materials and loading them to take to the dump. A  solid chunk of brick and mortar  estimated to be 12 inches by 18 inches  fell  from the side of the building and toward the scaffold. It startled Employee  #1  who was on the scaffold work platform that consisted of three 2-inch by  10-inch nominal boards. Employee #1 reacted to the falling debris and  apparently jumped to the concrete slab located 6 feet  4 inches below.  Witnesses believed that he landed on his feet  but his knees buckled  and he  went down to the floor. Other employees and the owner rushed to aid Employee  #1  who got to his feet but was unstable. Employees noticed some blood around  his mouth  and the owner called emergency medical services. Employee #1  reclined and waited for an ambulance. Lexington Hospital was directly across  the street. However  the ambulance apparently came from Columbia and arrived  approximately 40 minutes later  according to witnesses. Employee #1 was then  transported to Palmetto Richland Memorial Hospital and admitted. He died the  following day in the hospital.",

It apportioned some of the work out to an unlicensed subcontractor  and mason crew foreman. The injured employee had been working at the  construction site for less than 2 weeks. He was performing the duties of a  masonry day laborer  and he was working for the subcontractor. Workers for the  subcontractor had moved a three-tier scaffold over a bit so that a forklift  could be brought into the atrium of the building. The scaffold had been  inspected by the general contractor. When the scaffold was moved from its  original position  planks on its third tier were no longer resting on the  ledges that had previously provided support. At the time of the accident  the  employee was performing his regularly assigned task of laying masonry bricks  and cinder blocks while standing on a scaffold. The employee was walking on  the scaffold in that area  when he stepped on an unsupported plank. The plank  fell  and the employee fell with it  approximately 20 feet (6.1 meters) onto  the ground. He sustained fractures  and he was taken to USC Medical Center. He  was hospitalized for 19 days. The Division was notified by the Burbank fire  department of the accident on November 2  2011.

He was working at a construction venture being run  jointly by American Bridge Company and Fluor Enterprises  Inc. He had been in  the trade for approximately 11 to 12 years. The project was the replacement of  the east span of the San Francisco - Oakland Bay Bridge. The project's staging  area was a large yard covering several acres and containing mobile office  buildings  located in Oakland  CA. The actual bridge work extended over San  Francisco Bay. The incident occurred inside horizontal open box girder # 12   located mid-span on the bridge. The employee and his coworkers were removing  pieces of horizontal angle iron used to mechanically hold the horizontal  sections of the open box girder sections in place until they could be welded  together. At the time of the incident  the employee was removing one of the  angle iron plates. As he was standing on a work platform from which he was  working  his left foot slipped. He fell onto a structural member of the work  platform. His left hip struck the structural member  and he sustained a  fracture of at least one and possibly both of his hips. The employee was taken  to a local hospital  where he was treated for his injuries for more than 24  hours. At approximately 8:30 a.m. that day  the Cal/OSHA DOSH Oakland District  office received a report of this serious workplace health and safety injury  from the Oakland Fire Department via telephone. At approximately 2:10 p.m. on  July 30  2012  the Division arrived at the place of employment  which was the  east landing of the San Francisco - Oakland Bay Bridge renovation project  in  Oakland  CA  and conducted an opening conference with management.",

Employee #1 was working from atop a  concrete pier under the bridge decking and had limited crawl space and height.  He had almost completed cutting on his first beam when he apparently tripped  on material that had accumulated from a small break at the edge of the  concrete pier  or from some related cause. He pulled on the hose and then lost  his balance and footing due to slack in the crossbracing of the bridge  support. Employee #1 fell from the bridge pier and was killed. It is possible  that hot sparks or insects also contributed to this accident. Employee #1 was  not wearing a safety belt or lanyard  nor was a net furnished. There were no  eyewitnesses.",

The crew was hanging under the  bridge installing support beams that were being raised by a hydraulic crane to  a point just beneath the bridge deck. Each beam weighed approximately 1 000 lb  and consisted of two 12 in. by 13 ft wide C-channel beams with a 3 ft long by  2 1/2 ft wide by 1 in. high steel plate bolted between them near the center.  The support beams were then stood across the top of the guardrails of an  aerial boom lift. There was one employee in the manbasket as the lift moved  each beam into position. The aerial lift was supported by planking placed  between the main bridge support girders. Employee #1 was standing under a  support beam  preparing to make the connection  when the pressure on the  planking became too great and it folded  causing the boom of the lift to jerk  and the support beam on the guardrails to topple and fall. The falling beam  grazed Employee #1's chest and then struck his leg and foot  severely bruising  his leg and amputating two of his toes and part of his foot. The aerial lift  was rated for a maximum load of 500 lb for both people and materials  but it  was carrying about 1 200 lb at the time of the accident. In addition  the  support beam had not been secured to the lift while it was being transported.",

        "text": "On July 13  2007  Employee #1 and coworkers were working on the thirty-fourth  floor of a high-rise construction  using jacks to lower a shoring formwork  table from the concrete slab above. The shoring table was being used to  support the floor slabs on the southwest side of the building as they were  poured. There was a catwalk attached to the top of the shoring table which  extended 6 ft over the edge of the building. This catwalk provided a work  platform to finish the edge of the concrete slab after it was poured. Employee  #1 entered the shoring table from the inboard side through one of the truss  webs to remove a piece of plywood that was nailed to the floor. While Employee  #1 was inside the truss  his coworkers at the ends of the truss were having  difficulty lowering the shoring table because the plywood deck on the table  was stuck to the underside of the concrete slab. A stringer beam connected  each end of the trusses. Employee #1's coworkers lowered the jacks to  approximately 6 in. below the jack point at the center of the stringer beam.  Employee #1 was at the east end of the shoring table and was using a very long  breaker bat to pop the plywood from the slab. He was able to separate them  when the table fell onto the jacks. Employee #1 was tied off to a retractable  cable that was anchored to a concrete column on the same side of the truss  that he had entered. When the table fell  it kicked out the jack on the east  end of the shoring table toward the inside of the building. The weight of the  catwalk pulled the truss over the edge of the building on the south side. As  the shoring table fell over the side of the building  Employee #1 was dragged  with sufficient force that it snapped the reractable cable. He fell with the  shoring table approximately 230 ft  dropping to an eleventh story setback. The  shoring table was destroyed and Employee #1 was killed. The other tables being  used in the building  did not have the catwalk attached to the top of the  shoring table  which added additional weight to the side.",

        "text": "On June 25  2006  Employee #1 was part of a crew that was removing antenna  equipment from a 1 900-ft communication tower for placement on another tower.  One of the workers was on the ground operating the Hydraulic Power Systems   Inc.  hoisting unit. Two workers were at a height of approximately 1 800 ft on  the tower  removing the equipment. Once it was free  they would connect it to  a 5/8-in. nylon rope  and the hoist operator would lower it to about the 600  ft level of the tower  where Employee #1 was located. He was connected to and  suspended by a 1/2 in. wire rope hoist line. Once the equipment reached him   he would connect it to the hoist line  and the hoist operator would then lower  him and the equipment to the ground. Employee #1 would disconnect the  equipment  and then be raised back up to wait for the next load. During the  course of the operations  Employee #1 was being raised when the nylon rope  broke. The approximately 100 lb equipment attached to the rope fell from  approximately 1 800 ft  as did a headache ball that was also attached to the  rope. The broken end of the rope became tangled on the rigging block that was  on top of the tower. This caused the nylon rope to suddenly stop  and the  shock caused the it to break again at a point just above the headache ball.  The nylon rope  headache ball  and equipment fell until they struck Employee  #1 on the hoist line. He was connected to the line with a CM chain repair link  that was not designed to be part of a personal fall protection or positioning  system. The link separated and Employee #1 fell about 550 ft to the ground. He  was killed. Subsequent investigation revealed several problems with the  hoisting system: the rigging  hoist line  and slings that were used to raise  personnel had not been installed with a 10:1 safety factor; Employee #1 was on  the hoist line while another load was suspended from the same hoist unit;  Employee #1 connected his fall protection/positioning device to a shackle  above the hook rather than using a lanyard that had been placed directly on  the hook; and no anti-two-blocking device was installed on the personnel  hoisting line. It was believed that the nylon rope was cut by the wire rope  where they both passed through the same double-block rigging device at  approximately 500 ft on the tower.",

He was standing on  top of the machine at rail level  watching the transmission being installed  onto a Wheel True Machine at the truck shop. There were three coworkers  standing below the rail lever bolting the transmission to a steel plate with  the transmission being held suspended using an overhead crane. A hook was  attached to the eyebolt to suspend the load using a steel plate with a hole in  the middle. The eyebolt was passed through the hole in the plate and secured  on the bottom using a nut and two washers. While the load was suspended inches  in the air  the eyebolt somehow broke into two pieces  causing the wire rope  cable to react through the opening  creating a helicopter effect. The wire  rope cable  and/or broken eyebolt/hook struck the employee on the right upper  cheekbone  knocking him to the floor. Employee #1 was taken to County USC  Medical Center by the paramedic  where he later died; the cause of death was  head trauma. Cal/OSHA determined the accident was caused by the mechanical  fatigue of the brand new eyebolt used to connect the load to the crane. The  forged steel eyebolt was rated with a work load limit of 4 000 lbs. and the  weight of the transmission was determined to be about 600 lbs. at the most.  The accident was caused by an unexpected mechanical failure.",

The accident occurred when one of the blocks  that weighed  approximately 4600 lbs  had been raised off the truck bed and after passing  more than halfway off the end of the truck  had the short loop section of  chain attached to the hoe bucket break causing the block to fall. Employee #1   who had been performing the rigging work up on the truck bed  was in close  proximity to the block at this time. When the block dropped  Employee #1 fell  from the truck or block and ultimately ended up prone  landing face first on  the ground. The block landed on its end beside him and then fell on its side   across his lower legs. Employee #1 had his left lower leg amputated with  severe injuries to the lower right leg. Examination of the broken chain sling  pieces  showed one broken link  wearing and stretching of other links  open  fractures in additional links were also noted. The employer did not perform  competent person sling inspections. Hazard recognition training was not  provided to employees using the rigging equipment. The chains in use were not  tagged to identified  no tags lines were used.",

        "text": "On May 12  2005  Employee #1  of Acorn Industrial  Inc.  was removing welds  from a 30 in. CHR pipe in a utility tunnel  so the pipe could be repositioned  and re-welded in place. The pipe was normally suspended by permanent supports  spaced throughout the tunnel  as well as by temporary \"trapeze\" supports  mounted to the ceiling and positioned to hold up the pipe where it was not  adequately held by the permanent supports during installation. In the place  where Employee #1 was working  there was no permanent support in place. On the  previous day  a separate crew had received approval from the foreman and from  Employee #1 to also remove the temporary support because this top run of pipe  had been completely fit up and tack-welded in place at two joints: the west  joint and the east joint. A subsequent inspection of the welds had revealed a  misalignment of the pipe at the west joint. To correct this  Employee #1 and  the foreman decided to remove about 18 in. of the 30 in. CHR pipe at the west  joint (including the misaligned weld)  refit the two pipe ends  and redo the  weld at this location. The pipe was manually rolled to allow access to all  portions of it  due to the close proximity to the north wall. During the  rolling of the pipe  three tack welds at the west joint cracked; they were  re-welded back in place  but they cracked again during subsequent rolling of  the pipe while the victim continued cutting the pipe at the east joint. After  the tack welds cracked the second time  the foreman and Employee #1 decided to  start over at the west joint. At this point Employee #1 had completely severed  the pipe at the east joint. The foreman told Employee #1 to check his rigging  and grind out the remaining three tack welds at the west joint with a  hand-held grinder. This would allow the crew to reposition the entire 30 in.  CHR pipe and weld it back in place. The foreman left the area to continue  layout for expansion joints in another vault  and Employee #1 and his helper  continued to work at the west joint. He ground out the three broken tack welds  while they were at the bottom of the pipe  instead of rolling the pipe to put  the tack welds in a better position. At this point  the only support for the  pipe was the permanent support  about 24 ft 4 in. away  and approximately 12  ft of the pipe extended over the support structure near the east joint. The  pipe was about 38 ft long before the removal of 18 in. at the east joint.  Employee #1 was removing the tack welds from the bottom of the pipe when it  fell  crushing his right arm against the 30 in. CHS pipe below. He suffered  injuries that required hospitalization. The temporary \"trapeze\" support would  have adequately held the pipe's weight if it had been reinstalled when the  workers realized they were going to remove the tack welds at the west joint  and completely sever the pipe at the east joint. Employee #1 had been using a  Ross \"come-a-long\" to help him shift/roll the pipe for the refit. The  \"come-a-long\" was off center and therefore not in place to support the pipe;  it could only provide offset force to shift or roll the pipe. -----",

The vehicle was backed to the edge of a lot pad approximately 4  feet above their level. The tool bar was elevated to its highest position to  allow the ripper shank to be drawn up into the bar's tool slot  and then  pinned into place for use. They were using a light crane mounted on the  coworker's service truck to lift the ripper shank into place. The load line of  the crane was lowered down through the slot to be pinned into position. The  chain was attached to the ripper by a welded eye on the end of the ripper   through which the chain had been looped and the chain hook slot fit to a link  to form a loop. The ripper bar had been pulled up to the bottom of the tool  bar and both workers were trying to align the top of the ripper to the slot in  the tool bar. The mechanic had a pry bar at the point of the ripper and  Employee #1 had a pry bar through the pin hole in the bar  twisting the ripper  bar in an attempt to get the ripper in place. As they were working  the chain  attaching the ripper bar to the crane hook became detached and the ripper  shank fell on Employee #1. He sustained crushing injuries and a torn aorta.  The coworker used his pry bar to lever the ripper shank off of Employee #1   and he then radioed for help. Employee #1 was transported by helicopter to the  hospital  where he died as a result of his injuries.",

One side of the  tail pulley section had been removed  and Employee #3  at ground level  was in  the process of removing the panel from the other side of the tail pulley. The  tail pulley section buckled then collapsed  causing the rest of the bucket  elevator leg to collapse. Both Employee #1 and Employee #2  at the 93 foot  level  rode the bucket elevator leg down as it collapsed inside the vertical  ladder cages until the upper section landed on top of an adjacent steel grain  bin. Employee #3 was struck by the collapsing lower section of the bucket  elevator leg and was pinned from the waist down. The feed mill employees heard  and witnessed the collapse and called 911. Emergency crews rescued all three  employees; they were taken to Sedan City Hospital by ambulance. Due to the  height of the falls  the injuries sustained by Employee #3  all three  employees were taken by Life Flight to St. Francis Hospital in Wichita   Kansas. Employee #1 and Employee #2 were released the next day  and Employee  #3 was kept in intensive care.",

Other  coworkers stated that there was no mid-rail on the balcony and that the  railing  which failed  had been attached to the outside of the framing.  Emergency medical personnel were summoned. They arrived and transported  Employee #1 to a hospital. He suffered injuries causing neck and leg pain  but  no fractures were identified.

Employee #1 was part of a road construction crew that  was preparing a site for a roadway. As part of the project  a lake that was in  the path of the planned roadway had to be filled  using sand from an adjacent  \"borrow pit\". Employee #1 began operating the Model Number D9H bulldozer at  approximately 8:00 a.m. and moved the bulldozer to the lake at approximately  8:45 a.m.  after another bulldozer suffered a mechanical failure. The  superintendent instructed Employee #1 about the fill pattern (east to west)  and left him unattended. At approximately 9:30 a.m.  the superintendent  who  was working 200 yards north of the lake  noted the absence of sound for the  fill location at the lake. He proceeded to the lake but was unable to find the  Model Number D9H bulldozer or Employee #1. Employee #1 had driven the  Caterpillar bulldozer into the lake  while moving fill material  and he  drowned. The Investigation revealed that the Model Number D9H bulldozer was in  reverse  and the throttle position was at full  as confirmed by underwater  photographs. The transmission had three forward and three reverse gears. For  unknown reasons  Employee #1 had pushed a large amount of fill into the lake   in the center of the fill area  instead of moving in a consistent left to  right pattern. The reason for the left to right pattern was to slowly extend  the line of fill into the lake consistently  so that it could support the  weight of the equipment. It appears that the Model Number D9H bulldozer was on  this central peninsula  which failed under the weight  and caused the  bulldozer and Employee #1 to enter the lake.",

The  bulldozer operator would normally make three runs (forward and backward)  spreading the pile of dirt by thirds about 30 to 50 feet from the pile. At the  time of the incident the bulldozer operator was filling in a slight hole about  2 inches deep caused by the blade of the dozer dipping on his last backward  run. The hole was only about 20 feet forward of where the operator directed  the dump truck operator to dump the dirt. This made the forward run a lot  shorter than normal. The bulldozer operator made his run forward  however   stopped shorter than normal due to the dirt filling in the hole. The bulldozer  operator would normally put the dozer in reverse on the fly which means as he  is moving forward he would raise the blade  slow down  put it in reverse   start moving backwards  lower the blade  and then look behind him. Since it  was a shot run (only 10 - 15 feet to fill in the hole)  as he started to move  backwards it was about 2-3 seconds before he looked behind him  and when he  did noticed either the hard hat or survey rod fly in the air and he knew he  had struck the employee. The employee either had started to walk behind the  bulldozer once it passed him or was standing to close to the dirt pile and was  struck when the bulldozer operator turned to line up his next run with the  pile.",

        "text": "At 1:00 p.m. on March 14  2013  Employee #1 and Employee #2  of Los Angeles  Engineering Inc.  a general engineering and pipeline construction company   were working on a pipeline construction project. They were excavating a trench  for the purpose of installing steel reinforced concrete pipe for a storm  drain. They were in a section of the trench that lacked any shoring or other  protection and checking the depth. The trench measured 14 feet deep. Coworker  #1 was operating a backhoe in the trench  excavating soil from a trench  cave-in that had occurred along the south wall two hours earlier. Coworker #2   the supervisor  was in the immediate area of the earlier collapse  operating a  front loader atop the north wall of the trench at surface grade level. The  north wall of the trench collapsed. It collapsed directly on Employee #1   pushing him into the south wall of the trench and completely burying him.  Employee #1 was killed. The collapsing trench pushed Employee #2 against a  trench shield in a shored section of the trench  burying him to his thighs.  Emergency personnel were called  and at 1:45 p.m. the Los Angeles Fire  Department dispatched fire and rescue resources to the site. At 1:55 p.m.  the  Los Angeles Fire Department notified Cal/OSHA. Fire Department personnel  exposed Employee #1's head and determined that he was dead. They began a  recovery operation that lasted 7 hours. Employee#2 was extricated from the  trench and transported by air ambulance to UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center   where he was hospitalized and treated for trauma to his legs  including one or  more leg fractures. Cal/OSHA  which immediately responded after being notified  by the Los Angeles Fire Department  arrived at the site at 3:00 p.m. Cal/OSHA  contacted the employer  fulfilling reporting requirements. Cal/OSHA's  investigation determined that Employees #1 and #2 were working in a 14-foot  deep trench that was not protected from a cave-in by any protective systems or  procedures. The trench in which they were working had caved in two hours  earlier. When the second cave-in occurred  killing Employee #1 and seriously  injuring Employee #1  their supervisor was in the immediate area and was in  possession of engineering documents indicating that employees must not work in  the unprotected sections of the trench. ACCIDENT RELATED-SERIOUS CITATIONS  ISSUED: Cal/OSHA planned to issue a Willful Serious Accident Related citation  for a violation of T8 CCR 1541.1(a)  a serious citation for a violation of  1541(k)  and a serious citation for a violation of 1509(a).",

An  excavation was dug 17 ft long by 8.5 ft deep by 5 ft wide. The soil on site  was a combination of water saturated material including clay and backfill from  being previously excavated. No shoring was installed and a pump was installed  to control the water leaking into the excavation. Once the water main was  located  two coworkers entered the excavation to clean and complete the  repair. The coworkers discovered they did not have the appropriate clamp and  exited the excavation. Employee #1 informed the other coworkers he was going  to go and get a larger clamp. A coworker asked if he could go back into the  excavation to complete cleaning the main. Employee #1 informed the coworkers  to watch the sides of the excavation while he was cleaning the main. A 13 ft  long by 8.5 ft high section of the vertical east side collapsed into the  excavation totally covering Employee #1. The coworkers entered the excavation  to try to rescue the employee. They were able to uncover Employee #1's head  and body and then extracted the employee out of the excavation with the aid of  the first responders. Employee #1 was transported to a medical facility  where  he later dies.",

A wall of spoils pile dirt lined  the southeastern wall of the excavation with a service road just wide enough  for a skid steer to operate up and down the side of it. The north/western side  was fairly open with the exception of one spoils pile of dirt left on a  concrete pad at the excavation edge. Within 20 yards of this area  Employee #1  was operating to remove soil from the pit and loading it into the dump  trailers that had backed up to this same area. Speculation was that Employee  #1 entered the excavation to examine an area where a foul fuel-like odor  emanated from a recently removed bucket of soil. Within seconds of entering  the excavation  the side wall exploded outward striking Employee #1 from  behind and burying him completely. Witnesses to the event quickly ran to his  aid in an effort to free him from the soil. Emergency services arrived to  complete the rescue efforts and transported him to the hospital. Employee # 1  was later pronounced dead. He had sustained fatal injuries from the weight of  the soil as it struck him to body and head.",

        "text": "At approximately 10:00 a.m. on or about December 11  2013  Employee #1 and  Coworker #1  electrical engineers employed by Web Electric Inc.  were working  at a retail store. They were assigned to repair a broken heater in the store's  rear storage room. Employee #1 had been on site the previous day  December 10   2013  to review the scope of the assignment and the material involved.  Employee #1 and Coworker #1 replaced the electric contact on the heater.  Employee #1 then went to check the 480 Volt Westinghouse Fusible Distribution  Panelboard (FDP)  Category FDPT3833 #3 panelboard unit in the store's  electrical cage  located in a separate room adjacent to the storage room  to  make sure that the heater could be energized. The panelboard unit  measuring  approximately 8 inches tall by 14 inches long  was installed along with other  panelboard units  approximately 3 feet from concrete on grade. The panelboard  unit contained a shutoff switch on the front side of the dead front panel to  disconnect the interior front fuse panel from the live busbar that energized  the panel from the interior rear of the panel unit. Employee #1 turned the 480  Volt  60 Amp T3833 FDP #3 switch to the off position and opened the dead front  to expose the TRS90R 90 Amp fuses in the panel. After a visual inspection of  the interior of the panelboard unit  Employee #1 metered the fuses in the  panel to ensure that the fuse panel was not energized. He determined that two  of the three fuses were inoperable and needed replacement. Employee #1 removed  the fuses with an insulated fuse puller. He then wound up the electrical meter  and took off his gloves. The door to the panelboard had swung into an almost  closed position and sat slightly ajar  approximately 3 inches. Before starting  toward his vehicle to retrieve two new fuses  Employee #1 reached to shut the  electrical panel door  so that store employees would not be exposed to an  electrical hazard while he was gone. As Employee #1 shut the panel door  a  live T3833 FDP #1 panelboard unit  approximately 8 inches above the FDP #3  that Employee #1 had been working in  and that had not been previously opened  and was dead front  had one or more arc flashes. The flashes blew out the top  of the dead fronted T3833 FDP #1  causing irreparable blast and burn damage.  The interior of the T3833 FDP #3 had burn marks on a small section of the  panel door. Employee #1 was seriously burned. He also experienced brief  blindness due to the flash. Coworker #1  who had been standing to the side   approximately 3 feet from the panel unit  also experienced brief blindness   but was otherwise uninjured. Emergency services were called  and Employee #1  was transported and admitted to Tuomey Hospital  and subsequently transferred  by emergency transport to the Augusta Burn Center. He was treated for second  and third degree burns to his hand and forearm. South Carolina OSHA's  subsequent investigation determined that Employee #1 had been wearing ANSI  Class 2 - 17 000 Volt electrical gloves  a fire resistant shirt  and safety  glasses while working  although  as noted above  he had removed his gloves  shortly before the arc flash event.",

As the burning sensation  became progressively worse  Employee #1 exited the concrete and reported to  his supervisor that his legs were burning. His supervisor told him to sit down  and put vinegar on his legs. Employee #1 complied and began to pour vinegar on  his legs. This caused the area to smoke and created additional pain. Employee  #1 continued to work for a few days after the incident. However  due to the  pain  he went to the hospital emergency room on July 31  2013  where he was  diagnosed  admitted  and treated for second and third degree burns.

The skillet was located approximately 5 ft  below ground level. Employee #1 and the coworker entered the hole and had  removed seven of the eight bolts securing the skillet. They were beginning to  remove the last bolt when they heard a hissing sound and butane vapor began to  gush out into the hole. The two men attempted to resecure the skillet  but  were unable to. The coworker began to feel lightheaded and he scrambled up out  of the hole  while Employee #1 tried again to resecure the skillet. A foreman  saw what was happening and jumped into the hole to try to stop the leak and  Employee #1 remained in the hole to assist him. When the foreman began to feel  lightheaded  he scrambled up and out of the hole. When Employee #1 finally  tried to get out  he collapsed and fell backward to the bottom of the hole.  Seeing this  his coworker jumped back into the hole and  with the assistance  of coworkers at ground level  was able to get Employee #1 up and out of the  hole. He was unresponsive  had no detectable heartbeat  and was not breathing.  Attempts to revive him were unsuccessful and Employee #1 was pronounced dead  upon arrival at Miami Valley Hospital. He died of asphyxia due to inhalation  of butane gas. The president of the company had not considered this hole to be  a permit-required confined space because he did not expect any significant  amount of butane to be present in the portion of the pipeline system affected  by this blank. Consequently  he took no traditional confined entry precautions  either immediately preceding or during this entry.",

Employee # 2 and Employee # 3 was working from a man  basket fixed to the boom of a National 1800 series crane  and Employee #1was  working from a man basket attached to the boom of an Aztec hydraulic crane.  The pole was one of three setting at the outside of a ninety degree turn in  the line. The triple pulley was position approximately eight feet high on the  pole. The hard line cable was tide off to the pole using a preformed cable  grab and synthetic sling. The puller truck released the cable and allowed some  slack on the back side of the cable grab. Employee #1 opened the single pulley  using tag lines to position the loop of the slack cable into the triple  pulley. The cable appeared to slip in the preformed grab position and  completely released. This allowed the hardline cable to be pulled toward the  center pole and catch the basket containing Employee # 2 and Employee # 3. The  force of the cable struck the basket and boom of the crane  causing the end of  the pin with the keeper to come out of the bracket on the boom. One side of  the bracket on the boom was separated. Employee # 2 and Employee # 3 fell from  the basket to approximately 95 feet to the ground. Both employees were killed  on impact at the scene.",

Initially  they were not  sure whether to use \"TEK\" screws and a flange attached to the bottom of the  tray  or a \"Unistrut\" attached to a tray support. After the discussion   Employee #1 and his supervisor went to the supervisor's truck and got the  materials for both methods. The supervisor then left the site. Employee #1  returned inside and decided to use the \"TEK\" screw method. He was using a  portable electric drill to make holes in the bottom of the tray when he  drilled into the energized 480 volt line  resulting in an arc blast. Employee  #1 suffered second- and third-degree burns on his hands  arms  and face that  required skin grafts. He was hospitalized for between four and five weeks.",

The crew  member and the USACE Inspector performed Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  but were unable to resuscitate him. The U.S. Coast Guard was notified. The  Coast Guard met the tug/barge at the entrance of the New Haven Harbor and  moved the employee to Coast Guard boat at 11:50 p.m. Employee #1 had died and  was taken to Yale New Haven Hospital. It was determined that during the trip  to New Haven  the employee had a mobile gas powered generator  used to power  the charging unit of the hand-held radio and a small electric heater for use  in the scow house.

Two coworkers initially entered the tunnel with  a golf cart at approximately 7:45 a.m. to drop off equipment after activating  the ventilation fan from outside. Approximately 8:00 a.m.  they exited the  tunnel to wait for the concrete truck to arrive at the site. Approximately  9:30 a.m.  Employees #1 through #5 entered the tunnel with the concrete load.  Concrete was carried in eight buggy carts pulled by bobcat. Behind them  the  mechanic and Project Superintendent followed on a propane-operated golf cart.  Around 10:00 a.m.  these employees arrived at the work location and found that  the mechanical ventilation fan had been shut down. Several unsuccessful  attempts were made to start the fan. The Project Superintendent and foreman  decided that work would continue  after measuring the natural air flow using a  handheld Mini Thermo-Anemometer by Extech Instrument. At 11:15 a.m.  the  foreman radioed from inside tunnel that employees were experiencing difficulty  breathing  chest pains  and fatigue. The project superintendent sent golf  carts and removed all employees from the tunnel about 12:16 p.m. Employees #1  through #5 were treated for asphyxia and carbon monoxide poisoning at  University Medical Center (UMC) in Las Vegas and St. Rose De Lima in  Henderson. All five employees were treated at UMC with hyper-oxygen therapy.  Reports from the employer confirmed that employees' carboxy-hemoglobin  concentrations ranged between 12 and 32.",

Employee #1 was using a gasoline-powered concrete saw to cut the floor of the  work area. They had been cutting for less than an hour when Employee #2 left  for a brief period. Upon his return  he found Employee #1 slumped over.  Employee #1 was pulled out of the room  and emergency medical personnel were  summoned. Upon their arrival  the fire department determined that the level of  carbon monoxide was 450 ppm in the work area and 300 ppm in the back of the  store. They cleared the building and began ventilating it. Employee #1 was  taken to a medical center  where he was treated in the hyperbaric chamber and  then hospitalized. He had a carboxyhemoglobin level of 37  which dropped to 18  after he was on oxygen for two to three hours and spent one-and-a-half to two  hours in the hyperbaric chamber. Employee #2 was taken to a different  hospital  where his carboxyhemoglobin level was measured at 16.9. He received  oxygen for two hours and was released. Even though ventilators were available   Employees #1 and #2 did not use them. They thought they had adequate  ventilation for the short duration of the job.",

He was making a furring strip measuring 1.25  inches by 2.83 inches by using a Bosch Table Saw Model 4100 to rip a 2-inch by  4-inch board of redwood lumber. While operating the table saw  he sustained a  serious cut to his right hand. Emergency services were called  and the San  Francisco Fire Department responded. Employee #1 was transported to the  hospital  admitted  and treated for three finger amputations (index  ring  and  pinky fingers) and damage to the tendons of the middle finger of his right  hand. The San Francisco Fire Department reported this incident to Cal/OSHA   which began its investigation August 22  2013. The investigator determined  that Employee #1 had more than 27 years of carpentry experience and was  knowledgeable in the use and hazards of table saws. During the interview   Employee #1 asserted that he had not removed the blade guard (hood assembly).  He did acknowledge that he was not using a push stick  because he did not  think it was necessary. The investigation report stated that if the guard was  not removed  the primary cause of this accident was the failure to use a push  stick. Because the employee was working alone  and the employer was not  present  the employer's knowledge could not be established. Therefore  no  serious accident-related violation was issued. The employer was cited for  failure to timely report the serious injury to the District Office of  Cal-OSHA.",

Bay Wide Glass  Inc. was a glazing contractor   with a California C-17 glazing contractor's license. The company had one  location and nine employees. The incident took place in a small warehouse  behind the offices  where sheet glass products were brought in  stored  worked  on  and shipped out. The company used a modified Perry Model Number PD-3  drywall cart to transport sheet glass between transport vehicles and rack  storage in the warehouse. The dry wall cart was configured to hold glass  sheets at a nearly vertical angle. The cart supported the sheets 33 inches  (0.84 meters) above their bottom edge. From time to time  sheets of glass were  left in the cart. Because of a canceled job  ten sheets of 72-inch by 100-inch  (1.83-meter by 2.54-meter)  0.25-inch-thick (6.35-milimeter-thick) flat mirror  glass sheets had been left stacked in the drywall cart on February 8  2013.  The weight of this stack was approximately 1 440 pounds (653 kilograms). On  February 14  the employee was working in the warehouse. The drywall car was in  the way  so he tried to move it. The cart and its load tipped over and fell  toward him  striking his lower left leg and causing a fracture. The immediate  cause of the incident was that the stack of mirror glass sheets loaded on the  drywall cart was stored in a manner that created a hazard. The cart was  unstable and liable to tip over and fall. The Livermore-Pleasanton Fire  Department informed the Cal/OSHA DOSH Oakland District office by telephone of  the incident.",

He then began to close the hatch before descending from the tank. He  lost his balance and fell approximately 10 feet 3 inches from the catwalk to  the ground level along the right side of the tank trailer. Employee #1  required 2 days hospitalization and treatment for multiple fractures of the  right foot and ankle and a fractured right kneecap.

The employee was rescued and transported to UCLA Medical Center  where he  was hospitalized. The Cal/OSHA Division was notified of the accident by the  Los Angeles Fire Department at 3:50 p.m. on June 4  2012. The Division  initiated an inspection at 5:25 p.m. on June 4  2012. The employee was  employed by Prkacin Company  Glendale  California  a pipeline construction  company. The investigation determined that the employee had been working at  the job site for two months  performing the duties of a laborer. At the time  of the accident  he was assigned to remove soil and broken pipe from the  bottom of a trench measuring 21 feet deep by 25 feet long. Trench shields  extended from top to bottom along most of the length of the trench  but the  4-foot section at the end of the trench was shielded only along the bottom 4  feet. The soil had sloughed away from the trench sides in the area of the  4-foot shield  creating a void where the employee would discard the shoveled  soil and debris. The soil in the trench was a very granular type C. While the  employee was in the trench  soil sloughed off the trench wall behind the  full-length trench shields and flowed into the trench. The flowing soil pushed  the employee into the trench jacks  resulting in his injuries. The employee  was working within close proximity to a witness at the time of the accident.",

Painters near the  excavation heard the employee yell and ran over along with masons and framers  to dig the employee out of the collapsed trench. Emergency services was  called  and fire and ambulance services responded to the site. Employee #1 was  dug out of the trench  but refused medical treatment and was taken home. A few  hours later  Employee #1's legs went numb  and he called emergency services  and was taken to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital. Employee #1 was diagnosed  with fractures to two vertebrae  his pelvis  and four ribs. Employee #1 was  hospitalized for four days. The investigation concluded that the employer   County Sanitation Company Inc.  did not have a competent person on site and  did not have an employee in an excavation protected from cave-ins.",

        "text": "At approximately 10:00 a.m. on December 21  2013  Employee #1  a painter  employed by a construction contractor  was engaged in interior  remodeling/alterations work at a restaurant. His employer was the general  contractor for the project. However  there was no foreman at the site  and all  workers other than Employee #1 were employed by subcontractors. Employee #1  was patching drywall near and on the 14-foot ceiling while standing on a  Werner 10-foot fiberglass step ladder. This extra heavy duty ladder had a  rated working load of 300 pounds. Employee #1 was 5 feet 4 inches tall and  weighed 163 pounds. Employee #1 was holding the patching compound and spatula  while standing on the second step below the topcap of the step ladder. The  ladder tipped to one side  and Employee #1 fell to the ground  a fall height  of 10 feet. Nearby subcontractor workers heard the fall and saw Employee #1  lying on the ground in pain. They phoned a foreman who was at another  location. The foreman came to the restaurant and called for emergency  services. An ambulance arrived  and Employee #1 was transported to San  Francisco General Hospital. He was admitted and treated for compressed neck  vertebrae  a large hematoma on the right upper side of his head  nerve damage   and spinal pain. He remained hospitalized for four days. This event was  reported to Cal/OSHA on either December 21 or December 23  2013  by a relative  of Employee #1. During the subsequent investigation  begun at the job site on  January 10  2014  interviews were conducted with the employer  Employee #1   and Employee #1's relative. It was established that Employee #1 was standing  on the second step below the ladder's topcap  and this step was 7 feet 8  inches above the ground. He was leaning past the ladder side rails while  patching the drywall. His work position contributed to his fall. The  investigation revealed conflicting versions of what happened next and how soon  the ambulance arrived. Initially  the size and height of the step ladder also  were in dispute. According to Employee #1  after he fell he had to wait  approximately 45 minutes for a foreman to arrive from another jobsite. When  the foreman arrived  he removed the fallen ladder and wanted to move Employee  #1 to his (Employee #1's) house before contacting an ambulance. Employee #1   who was still on the ground  was screaming in pain and said not to move or  touch him and to call the ambulance. The foreman finally made the call for  emergency services. In contrast  according to the employer  a foreman employed  by another company  who was doing the employer a favor by opening up the  jobsite while the employer was away in Canada  called him and reported the  fall event to him. The employer then instructed the foreman to go to the  jobsite. According to the employer  who stated he was on the phone with the  foreman the entire time  it took the foreman approximately 10 minutes to  arrive at the job site. When the foreman arrived  the employer told him to  call emergency services. Based on the Cal/OSHA investigation  the employer was  cited a general accident-related violation: T8 CCR '3276(e)(15)(A) requires  employees to work near the middle of the step and not to overreach. Other  standards relating to ladders were violated  and the employer was cited  accordingly. However  the investigation was not able to establish employer  knowledge. At the time of the investigation report  Employee #1 was taking six  different prescribed medications daily  wearing a frontal neck brace to  minimize vertical movement  and walking with a cane. He had experienced three  seizures  each requiring emergency services and transport to the hospital. In  addition  Workers' Compensation documents had not been given to Employee #1   and he had not received wages for the work performed on December 21  2013  the  day of the fall.",

He was working from a  6-foot A-frame ladder. The ladder was set up in a room where the carpenter was  attempting to install a large  heavy piece of plywood over ceiling framing 8  feet above the floor. The employee fell from the ladder. He was transported to  the hospital  admitted  and treated for serious head and facial fractures. He  was hospitalized for more than a month and  at the time of this report   remained in a skilled nursing facility. The employee's fall was reported to  the employer  the project's General Contractor  at 1:07 p.m. on March 14   2013. Cal/OSHA opened its investigation on April 4  2013. (The investigation  report did not indicate when Cal/OSHA was notified  and the reason for the  three-week delay in opening this case was unclear.) Cal/OSHA's investigation  determined that the ladder involved was a Special Duty Type 1AA  2011 Werner  Co. 6-foot A-frame ladder with a 375-pound load capacity. The investigation  report concluded that the employee's fall was caused by the employer failing  to prohibit employees from carrying equipment or materials which prevent the  safe use of ladders. By carrying a large  heavy piece of plywood up the  ladder  the employee appeared to have lost his balance. Serious  accident-related citations issued to the employer included: 3275(e)(15)(B)  Failing to prohibit employees from carrying materials up ladders  preventing  their safe use.",

There was a large  rolling scaffold inside the warehouse  and employees used ladders to get onto  the drop ceiling. There were wood beams in the drop ceiling  but the spaces  between the beams  where the ceiling panels were located  did not support any  weight. When Employee #1 stepped onto one of the ceiling panels in the  interior drop ceiling  he broke through it  falling 8.5 feet onto the carpeted  floor of the hallway below. He sustained a dislocation of his thumb and a head  laceration in the fall. He was transported to Kaiser Hospital  where he was  hospitalized for more than twenty-four hours.",

Employee #1 was using an air  compressor to blow out the horizontal reinforcement holes at openings that  measured 34 in. by 58 in. Below the floor opening  there were 0.75-in. ceiling  planks that formed the ceiling of the room below. Employee #1 asked the  coworker to go out and check the compressor because it wasn't working  properly. The coworker called back to the employee that it was working.  Employee #1 knelt down to blow out one of the dowel holes and he fell into the  floor opening  breaking through the ceiling planks  and falling approximately  14.5 ft to the concrete slab floor. Employee #1 sustained unspecified  fractures and was hospitalized. It was determined that a contributing factor  to the accident was that the employee was not provided with any effective  means of fall protection.",

From the other information available from the manufacturer  it was  determined to be model EM-120S with 12 cubic ft. capacity. This equipment  consists of a motor unit and a mixer unit. The cylindrical mixer was 36 in.  long with a 27-in. diameter. The mixing paddles inside this barrel rotate on a  horizontal axis along the centerline of the mixer barrel. The top opening on  this mixer  measuring approximately in. ft by 30 in. is covered with a grated  cover  which opens automatically when the mixing barrel is tilted manually  with a handle to pour out mixed material. The grated cover has a grid of 3.5  in. by 3.5 in. openings. One of the bars on this grid was missing  which made  a set of 9 of these openings to measure 7 in. by 3.5 in. The clearance between  the mixing paddles and the grated cover was 6 in. Employee #1 remembered that   at the time of this accident  he was pouring dry cement into the mixer. He was  placing 90-pound cement bags  one at a time  on top of the grill cover  and  then he was cutting the bag with a knife to let the material fall into the  mixer. This equipment was manufactured with a bag cutter built on the grill  cover  which was missing along with a missing bar on this safety grate.  Employee #1 reached into the mixer with his right hand and his fingers got  caught between the rotating paddle and the side of the mixing barrel. Employee  #1 amputated about 1.5 in. of his right middle finger and about 0.5 in. of his  right index finger. He was hospitalized.",

Employee #1 entered the manhole in an attempt to render  assistance. As he was attempting to grab Employee #2  he collapsed. Another  laborer drove to a nearby grocery store to call for emergency assistance and  the company office. When he returned to the manhole  he and the another  employee flagged down a passerby and the called 911. The only cell phone for  the work crew was with Employee #2. Units from the Shelby County Sheriff's  Office  Shelby County Fire Department  and the Memphis Fire Department  responded to the incident. The first firefighter who entered the manhole was  wearing a self-contained breathing apparatus and was equipped with a four-gas  meter.

The homeowner began to excavate  about 4 inches below the existing foundation. Jacks were placed in the  basement of the house to hold up the portion that the addition was to be added  onto. Employee #1 dug an 8-inch deep by 18-inch wide trench approximately 4  inches away from the existing foundation wall so they could pour a concrete  footing. While digging this trench  a large section of the foundation wall  tipped over and struck Employee #1  killing him. During the accident  investigation  it was determined that that jacks may have contributed to the  accident. The jacks kept the house from collapsing  but added extra pressure  to the wall  which caused the foundation wall to tip over.",

        "text": "At 12:36 p.m. on August 6  2007  Employees #1 and #2  a foreman and an  electrician  respectively  for Koffler Electrical Mechanical Apparatus Repair   Inc.  were dispatched to a hotel boiler room to replace the broken motor of a  pump for the hotel's hot water piping system. There were four sets of motor  and pump units in the boiler room. Two months prior to this job  Employee #1  had replaced one of these set. On the day of the accident  they were replacing  another motor and pump unit. All the valves were shut and the motor and pump  unit had been removed from the 12 in. hot water pipe when a motor from one of  the other three units automatically restarted. Employee #1 heard a whooshing  sound coming from the open water pipe  and 120 degress F water started to  spray out. Employee #1 attempted to cap off the pipe; Employee #2 went to  notify the hotel engineer and then returned to help Employee #1. The hotel  engineer was checking the valves and tightening some nuts and bolts on the  couplings when Employees #1 and #2 were suddenly sprayed with hot water.  Paramedics responded and both employees were taken to St. Francis Hospital.  Employee #1 was treated for first- and second-degree burns to his abdomen.  Employee #2 was treated for first- and second-degree burns to the back of his  legs. The employer was cited for two general accident-related violations. The  hotel had only one check valve for the 12 in. hot water pipe that served the  entire 42-story building. There were no other intermediate check valves  throughout the piping system. California Code of Regulations T8 3329(d)  states: \"When dismantling or opening closed pressurized or gravity fed  systems  internal pressure shall be relieved or other methods utilized to  prevent sudden release of pressure or spraying of liquid.\" One of the  functions of the check valve would have been to prevent backflow. It was  discovered after the incident that the check valve was not working properly.  As a result  it did not have the capacity to stop the water from flowing back  into the boiler room. The other general accident-related violations are from  T8 GISO section 3314(c) and (g)  which require a lockout/de-energizing of  electrical equipment. Prior to the removal of the motor and pump unit  the  other 3 units were not de-energized to prevent them from building-up water  pressure of a minimum of 20 psi. The boiler was also not shut down to prevent  build-up of water temperature. A hazard control procedure was not developed by  the employer. A reference was also made to T8 3314(i)  which required on-site  lockout procedures to be followed by outside servicing personnel.",

The truck was  moving toward the next pole  which was at the top of a road with a 9 degree  slope when the strand became entangled in tree branches. The truck driver  stopped at the top of the slope  dismounted from the truck  and used a layup  stick to maneuver the strand through the trees. As he was finishing  the truck  started rolling down the slope and then hit an embankment on the right before  overturning to the left. Employee #1 was still secured by a personal arrest  system to the basket when it struck the ground. He was transported to Mountain  Community Hospital  where he was pronounced dead less than an hour later.

As it did  the choker caught on a bolt of the beam. A radio operator  signaled for the crane operator to stop  and the operator disengaged the  crane's clutch. Suddenly  the eye of the choker slipped off the shear  connection plate  causing the beam to flex and bounce. The sudden movement of  the beam threw Employee #1 from the beam. He fell 14 feet  5 inches to the  ground and fractured both wrists. He was hospitalized for four days. Two  contributing factors to the accident were that Employee #1 failed to clear the  choker completely from any part of the beam and that the radio operator did  not respond properly when the choker became caught on a bolt.",

However  the two  employees did not know that one of the cubicles remained energized from  another source of electric energy. On the door of that cubicle was a  red-stenciled sign that read  \"CAUTION MAY BE ENERGIZED FROM AN ALTERNATE  SOURCE.\" Neither employee noticed the sign  and the onsite employer did not  mention the alternate energy source to the employees. The following day  after  meeting with the onsite employer  the employees began to clean the cubicles.  When Employee #2 was cleaning the still-energized cubicle  he felt a slight  electric shock. He took out a 600-volt proximity tester  and it lit up without  touching the conductors. Employee #1 retrieved a voltage meter rated for 750  volts and placed the meter leads on the conductors. The meter failed and the  ensuing electric arc burned both employees. Employee #1 received second- and  third-degree burns. He underwent skin graft surgery and was hospitalized for  his injuries. Employee #2 was hospitalized for more than 24 hours. He received  pain medication for his burns. (The original form did not list Employee #2 on  an injury line.)",

Employee #1  a carpenter/stoneworker  was operating a Skil  Saw powered circular saw to trim a piece of lumber. The lumber  measuring 2  inches thick by 4 inches wide by 2 feet long  was too thick. Employee #1  attempted to reduce the thickness with the saw. He held the lumber with his  left hand and tried to grind or score the 4-inch surface to plane it down. The  saw kicked back and cut the palm of his left hand. The homeowner called  emergency services. The San Francisco Fire Department responded and  transported Employee #1 by ambulance to the California Pacific Medical Center  in San Francisco. He was admitted and treated for lacerated nerves  blood  vessels  and tendons of the left hand. He required hospitalization for six  days. Cal/OSHA received a report from the San Francisco Fire Department on  March 16  2013. The employer reported to Cal/OSHA four days later  apparently  not knowing the reporting requirement. Cal/OSHA conducted an investigation on  March 22  2013 at the worksite. The investigation included interviews with  Employee #1 and Coworker #1. The investigation determined that the employer  installs countertops and performs other stone related work for residential  homes. On the day the injury occurred  no foreman was present at the work  site. Employee #1 was functioning as lead worker. He had approximately 20  years of experience in woodwork and stonework  the last 10 working for  Stoneplus  Inc. Cal/OSHA cited the employer a general violation of 1509(a) for  not having an Injury and Illness Prevention Program. The Program requirement  includes a requirement for the employer to provide and document training for  employees. The employer had no documentation of Employee #1's training. In  addition  the use of the powered circular saw was not appropriate for reducing  the thickness of the wood board. The employer was also cited for not notifying  Cal/OSHA immediately of the work-related injury. The investigator observed  other violations  and the employer was cited accordingly.",

He was working alone  standing near the  garage entrance  and cutting a piece of trim to custom fit the new garage door  to the existing frame. The trim was a 3-foot to 4-foot long piece of 2-inch by  1-inch lumber  originally cut from a 16-foot long piece. Employee #1 was in  the process of cutting the lumber using a Craftsman 14 Amp 7.25-inch Circular  Saw  Model Number 320.10870. This was a left-handed saw that belonged to  Employee #1  although he was right-handed. He was handling the saw in his left  hand and holding the wood being cut with his right hand while kneeling down.  While making the cut  Employee #1 was pushing the saw with his left hand and  resisting the force with the wood in his right hand. He held the wood in an  underhanded position  with his right thumb grasping the wood over the top  his  palm supporting it from beneath  and his other fingers curling around the  back. He planned to slide his hand around toward the back of the wood to move  his hand/fingers further away from the saw blade. As he attempted to do this   the saw blade amputated his right hand's pinkie finger just past the first  knuckle. He required hospitalization for the amputation. At 3:53 p.m. on  October 23  2012  the employer reported this event to Cal/OSHA. Employee #1  later told the Cal/OSHA investigator that he may have misjudged how close his  hand was to the advancing blade  how far his fingers were crosswise to the  blade  and the depth the blade was set to cut. From the interview with  Employee #1  the investigator concluded that Employee #1's assessment of what  he might have done differently to avoid injury was faulty. Specifically   Employee #1 did not utilize the following safe practices indicated in the  Operator's Manual for the saw: \"Do not reach underneath the work. Always clamp  the work piece securely so it will not move when making the cut. Avoid awkward  operations and hand positions where a sudden slip could cause your hand to  move into the blade.\" According to the investigation report  the primary  factor leading to this injury was the employer's failure to provide training  to Employee #1. The employer was relying on the employee's past experience.  This  in turn  led to the employee using poor and/or faulty judgment to assess  the hazards involved.",

At 9:00  a.m.  Employee #1 appeared restless and uncomfortable and collapsed while on  the fourth deck. His coworker called emergency medical services. Another  coworker (with a personal hydrogen sulfide monitor) entered the area  climbed  to the fourth deck  and administered CPR. The hydrogen sulfide level was  nondetectable. The fire department was called at 9:07 a.m. and arrived  on-scene at 9:27a.m. Employee #1 was moved to ground level from the fourth  deck catwalk and was transported to the morgue. The coroner reported that  Employee #1 died from hypertensive coronary artery disease. The incident was  determined to be nonwork related.",

The temperature was approximately 85  degrees with approximately 65 percent humidity. The crew had completed its  Risk Management Worksheet meeting and had contacted the utility company about  the utility disabling the enclosure on the substation breaker. The employer  had grounded a truck and redirected all foot traffic near overhead lines.  Employee #1 was wearing his protective helmet  harness and lanyard  safety  glasses  FR2 long sleeve shirt with a 100 percent cotton t-shirt underneath a  long-sleeve FR2 shirt  and long FR2 pants. He was wearing Class 3 insulated  gloves that he tested on a daily basis and that had been factory tested for  30 000 volts on April 9  2013  plus leather gloves over the insulated gloves.  Employee #1 was approximately 45 feet high in an Altec AA-755-L Serial Number  1104-bz-3132 bucket that was last dielectrically tested on November 29  2013.  The bucket was on a 2004 Ford F750 material handling bucket truck Serial  Number 3FRXF76P94V673315. Once Employee #1 was in position  he installed  insulator sleeves and blankets to cover the energized line. He then put  tension on the center phase by hooking the power line to the jib head of the  material handling bucket  an action taken to relax the strain insulator so he  could unhook the 13.6 KV power line from the strain insulator on the middle  power line. Employee #1 had loosened the bolt from the strain insulator and  put his tools back in his tool holder  but the power line would not come loose  from the strain insulator. He was trying to get the power line loose when an  arc flash occurred between the head of the material handling jib and the  middle phase insulator extension link on the power pole. The arc flash crossed  Employee #1. Emergency services were called  and Employee #1 was transported  by ambulance to Lexington Medical Center. Later that evening he was moved to  Augusta Burn Center. Employee #1 required treatment for first and second  degree burns across the front of his body. The subsequent investigation  determined that Employee #1 had been trained in maintaining proper clearance  and insulating power lines while working on electrical lines.",

The employer was Cable Brothers  Inc.  a telecommunication cable  installation company. Employee #1 was performing a regularly assigned task of  installing cable from one telephone pole to the next  in an attempt to install  a new telecommunication cable. Employee #1 used his climbing gaffs to climb  the telephone pole to the height necessary to install the telecommunication  cable. Employee #1 could not use a climbing belt because a plastic conduit  pipe ran up the side of the telephone pole. When he reached the working  height  he attempted to secure himself with the climbing belt. As Employee #1  was placing the belt under the plastic conduit  his improperly maintained  climbing gaff broke out  and he fell approximately 25 feet. Employee #1  sustained fractures to his skull and arms  as a result of the fall from the  telephone pole. Employee #1 was transported to St. Francis Medical Center for  treatment  and he was hospitalized. Cable Brothers notified the Division about  the accident on November 28  2012. Two employees were working with and in  close proximity to Employee #1  and both those employees were interviewed. The  investigation concluded that there was an accident-related violation for not  properly inspecting and maintaining the climbing gaffs. As a result  the  Division issued a serious accident related citation.",

When the mixture is  lacking proper consistency  the paddle mixing unit within the mixer can jam   which requires the operator to collect the jammed mortar and actuate the  clutch mechanism to reverse the direction of travel of the paddle wheel. This  can sometimes cause the mixer to snap back. As Employee #1 activated the  mixing machine's clutch mechanism  he was struck on the side of his head by  the handle of the clutch mechanism that extended from the mixing unit.  Employee #1 was hospitalized and treated for a severe concussion. The accident  investigation revealed that although the employer had a safety program   hazards associated with the clutch mechanism were not included. Additionally   the handle of the clutch mechanism was bent  when it should be straight as  designed. Also  the company had a safety latch located below the clutch handle  that was to be inserted into a slot when cycling the clutch; however  Employee  #1 failed to insert the latch.",

The pump  which was  stationed at ground level  was connected by 300 feet of hose to a Graco  Pistol-Grip Mastic Flo-Gun  with safety latch  connected to a heavy duty  extension pole with a Graco GHD 955 Tip  without tip guard. The airless  sprayer operated at 3 000 pounds per square inch of pressure. Employee #1  attempted to remove the clog by stabilizing the wand between his legs and  turning the \"SwitchTip\" handle with his right hand. In order to deflect the  spray from his eyes and face  he placed his left hand about four inches back  and away from the nozzle. The clog did not release from the nozzle  but  allowed a high pressure stream of coating to shoot into the inside base of the  middle finger of his left hand. The stream of coating created a 0.125-inch  laceration to his finger and injected the coating into his finger. Employee #1  was not wearing gloves. He was taken to the hospital  where his finger was  treated  but later amputated. He was hospitalized for his injury.",

        "text": "On July 31  2001  Employee #1 applied a wall coating  which contained  approximately 35 weight hydrocarbons onto the walls of a 500 square ft studio  apartment with an 8-square-ft ceiling. Employee #1 was applying the wall  coating for approximately 20 minutes using an airless spray gun and an  electric piston pump. During that time  Employee #1 may have applied as mush  as 8 gallons of the wall coating and generated significant concentrations of  vaporized and aerosolized hydrocarbons in the studio. Prior to spraying   Employee #1 had closed and covered the windows and shut the self-locking door  of the studio. The studio was not ventilated during the spraying. Another  employee found Employee #1 lying unconscious  face up on the floor of the  studio's walk-in closet  approximately 40 minutes after spraying had  commenced. The apartment complex maintenance manager assisted another employee  with carrying Employee #1 out of the studio. The maintenance manager stated  that the studio air had a strong odor and a heavy visible mist of overspray.  The maintenance manager performed a cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  emergency medical procedure on Employee #1 before he was transferred to the  hospital. Employee #1 died the next day. Representatives of the county medical  examiner's office concluded that Employee #1's death was accidental and was  caused by inhalation of vaporized and aerosolized hydrocarbons while spray  painting in an enclosed environment. Employee #1 was not wearing his  respirator at the time he was discovered unconscious  although the lack of  overspray on his face and the significant amount of overspray on the hair of  his head suggested that he had been wearing the respirator while spraying. The  employer required Employee #1 both to provide and to wear the full-face  negative pressure respirator with a canister that was sitting near him in the  studio. The respirator and its canister were not NIOSH-approved. The employer  did not have a Respiratory Protection Program  and was unable to provide the  required documentation  showing that Employee #1 had completed a respiratory  medical questionnaire  had been fit tested for his respirator  and had been  trained in the use of his respirator. At the time of this incident  Employee  #1 had worked for the employer for approximately two weeks during which he had  spray coated other apartments. Employee #1 spoke very limited English  but  spoke the same language as his employer.",

While the pilings  were being broken off  Employee #1 and coworkers were located in a coffer dam  below for additional cutting of the falling piling sections.

He had started to  step down to the floor when his lanyard or some part of his harness became  caught in the large barrel cooler  which was rotating at 4 rpm. The barrel  cooler pulled him backward and rotated him around  knocking him against the  guardrails as it turned. The coworker ran around to the other side to try to  free Employee #1 but he had already rotated around too high on the barrel and  was out of reach. The coworker then ran to get someone to turn off the barrel.  When he returned  he found that Employee #1's harness had detached from the  barrel cooler and he had fallen to the floor. Employee #1 sustained multiple  fractures and was killed.",

They were trying to set into place on the  second story of the building an 800-pound steel-framed wall measuring 6 feet 6  inches tall by 31 feet long. The wall fell over and landed on Employee #1's  leg. Emergency services were called  and Employee #1 was transported to the  hospital  admitted  and treated for a fractured leg. This event was  investigated by Washington State OSHA. According to the investigation report's  documentation of events  Employee #1 had pre-assembled the wall on the ground  and had added .5-inch plywood to the face for rigidity and a 6-inch piece of  cold roll steel channel on top for connecting the wall to the structure. On  the night of December 17  2013  the wall had been lifted by crane into the  space on the roof directly in front of the installation area. On the morning  of December 18  2013  the wall was not reattached to the crane for stability   and the only other support  a lanyard tied around a steel column and through  the window of the wall  was removed. The investigation determined that the  project manager/superintendent and the assistant safety director had assigned  Employee #1 and Coworker #1 the task of installing the wall. The field  engineer and the project manager/superintendent verbally admitted they did not  have a site-specific erection plan  did not inform Employee #1 and Coworker #1  of the wall's weight  and did not design any temporary type of guying or  bracing to secure the wall and protect the workers.",

He removed approximately 3 feet of cinder  block from the top of the wall to confirm the presence of reinforcing steel  and reduce the height of the wall. He observed that there was both vertical  and horizontal rebar in the wall and that the wall was stable. Coworker #1  removed the soil that was exposed after removing the top of the wall. He then  removed vertical slot sections of the wall approximately 6 inches wide to  obtain an approximately 4-foot section of wall  which he then would pull over  with the skid-steer. During these procedures Coworker #1 would continually  watch the wall for any indication of instability and pull on the wall with the  skid-steer to ensure it would not tip over. He saw no indication of any  structural problems. When the wall had been reduced to approximately 4 feet  from the ground  it contained a horizontal steel reinforcing bar that needed  to be cut before Coworker #1 could pull the wall down and enable the cutting  of the vertical reinforcing steel bars. Employee #1 was cutting these  horizontal steel reinforcing bars with a hand- held portable cut-off saw. The  first 4-foot section of wall had been removed following this procedure without  a problem. Coworker #1 prepared another 4-foot section of wall in the same  way. Employee #1 cut the top horizontal rebar  and then the next horizontal  rebar below  and began to position himself to cut the next rebar below. The  next 4-foot wide section of wall suddenly toppled and fell on him. Emergency  services were called  and the Los Angeles City Fire Department responded.  Employee #1 was transported to LAC+USC Medical Center  where he was admitted  and treated for a fractured pelvis and internal injuries. The Los Angeles City  Fire Department reported this incident to Cal/OSHA at approximately 8:45 a.m.  on September 10  2013. The employer reported the incident to Cal/OSHA at 7:55  a.m. on September 11  2013  after the employer learned that Employee #1 would  be hospitalized for more than 24 hours. The Cal/OSHA investigator arrived at  the work site at approximately 9:50 a.m. on September 19  2013 and began the  investigation. The investigation determined that the vertical steel  reinforcing bars in the wall were rusted away at the base and did not hold the  wall section up the way they had in the first section. The employer did not  block or brace the next wall section before allowing Employee #1 to work  adjacent to the wall  and he was injured when the wall fell over onto him. At  the time of this report  Cal/OSHA planned to issue a serious citation T8 CCR  1735(d)(4). Demolishing Buildings. (4) During demolition  continuing  inspections shall be made as the work progresses to detect hazards resulting  from weakened or deteriorated floors or walls  or loosened material. Employees  shall not be permitted to work where such hazards exist until they are  corrected by shoring  bracing  or other effective means.",

After completing the  second to the last sprinkler head  the employee went down with his plank to  the catwalk and moved to the right to finish his last sprinkler head. The  catwalk was 77.5 in. from the ground. The employee usually just slide/move his  plank from the top dryer cylinder to the other if he needed to advance to the  next sprinkler head but he could not do it at that point because the  succeeding top dryer cylinder was already removed by a coworker. The employee  instead tried to place his plank on top of the two lower dryer cylinders but  the plank could not be safely secured. So  the employee decided to remove the  plank and ask the supervisor how to access safely the last sprinkler head.  When he pulled the first time on the plank  it was stuck a little bit so he  tried to exert more effort. The plank suddenly came off causing the employee  to lose his balance and fall through the red danger tape in place of the  standard guardrail that was removed. The employee suffered broken ribs and  collar bone as a result of the fall  which required two days of  hospitalization at the Eden Medical Center in Castro Valley.",

This equipment was located on the two  different roofs: on the sloped roof of the church and on the flat roof of the  structure adjacent to the church. Employee #1 arrived at the jobsite  and  Coworker #1  a foreman  was present at the jobsite with two other coworkers.  It was Employee #1's first time working at this jobsite. Coworker #1 directed  Employee #1 to go up on the flat roof by using a fixed ladder to test some new  equipment that had just been installed. This fixed ladder was located against  the church wall and in a wide roof opening measuring approximately 10 feet  wide  8 feet long and 10 feet high. The open edges of this roof opening were  not guarded. Employee #1 and Coworker #1 went up on the flat roof. Both of  them were wearing harnesses but Employee #1 and Coworker #1 were not tied off.  The equipment to be tested was in the middle of the roof  far away from the  roof edge. Employee #1 was working on the equipment when he realized he needed  tools that were located back on the ground. To get back to the fixed ladder   Employee #1 and Coworker #1 had to pass by the edge of the roof opening. The  10 feet of this walkway near the opened roof's edge was approximately 24  inches wide and it was obstructed with three extending wood blocks that were  anchored to the roof to hold some other equipment along with a unistrut that  was holding a cable tray. Employee #1 tripped on one of these obstructions and  lost his balance  and fell off the opened roof's edge approximately 10 feet  below on the ground. Employee #1 fractured his right clavicle. Coworker #1  witnessed this accident. Employee #1 was transported to Stanford Hospital  and  he was hospitalized for two days. After the accident  the employer installed a  temporary guardrail on this opened side of the roof edge. The Division will  issue serious accident related citations to the employer for not providing  appropriate fall protection or guard rails to its employees when they were  exposed to a fall hazard.

Employee #1 was a 54-year-old painter with 20  years of experience  and had never worked for either Employer #1 or Employer  #2. At the worksite  Employee #1 was assigned to paint the chimney on the  outside of the house. Employee #1 placed a ladder to the right side of the  chimney and climbed on to the roof. He then used a rope to haul supplies to  the roof. Employee #1 was lifting a board up with the rope and slipped on the  wet roof. Employee #1 slid down the front side of the roof. He tried to grab  hold of the rafters on the roof  but was unable to stop his fall. Employee #1  fell approximately 17 feet into a rhododendron bush located below Employee  #1's working position. Employee #1 sustained multiple injuries from the fall   including five rib fractures on his left side  an orbital fracture on the left  side  and a fractured left clavicle. At the beginning of the work day   Employee #1 had driven his own vehicle to the worksite. Approximately 10  minutes after the accident  Employer #1 drove Employee #1 to Employee #1's  house in his vehicle. Employees from another worksite followed the vehicle to  Employee #1's house in order to drive Employer #1 back to the worksite.  Employer #1 did not implement use of fall protection or fall protection  systems when assigning work to employees at elevated work locations with known  exposed unprotected leading edges of the roof. Employer #1 also did not ensure  the availability of emergency medical services for this injured employee at  the time of injury.",

They were assisting in the  erection of a new classroom building measuring approximately 33 feet wide  44  feet long  and 19 feet high. The steel fabricator welded onto the steel  upright columns some erection aids to help erect and plumb the building before  welding the joints. Two of the erection aids were not welded properly to the  upright columns  and they broke loose when the steel trusses were set on the  aids as a coworker was winching the building plumb. Employee #1 and Employee  #2 were near the aids when the aids failed  and the steel structure hit them.  They both suffered injuries and were taken to Kaweah Delta Medical Center   Visalia  CA  for treatment. Employee #1 was hospitalized with unspecified  injuries. Employee #2 was treated for a fracture and released. The incident  was reported to Cal/OSHA by the employer on July 26  2011.",

The  I-beam was supported by three vertical 10 foot H-beam support columns.  Employee #1 cut one of the outer most end support columns at the floor level  completely in two. After cutting that column  the weight of the remaining  steel structure became off balanced and caused the middle column and the third  column to fall. Witnesses stated that it appeared that Employee #1 walked  under the steel structure after making the first column cut. Witnesses also  indicated that Employee #1 looked up as the structure began to fall on top of  him  but he could not get away. Witnesses stated that after the worker cut the  first column  there was approximately a four to five second pause before it  fell over. The collapse started at the south end column  which had been cut   and then the middle column began to pull away from its concrete anchor  supports. The third and last column held at the floor anchor supports  but the  sheer weight bent that column over causing total collapse. Workers in the area  ran to Employee #1's aid and used a 220 Komatsu excavator to lift the beams  off of Employee #1 and move it away. Emergency responders pronounced Employee  #1 dead at the scene.",

They were  removing obsolete grain handling equipment in preparation for the installation  of new  higher capacity equipment. The equipment being removed was on top of a  concrete silo owned by Global Ag. The millwright contractor's employees   including Coworkers #1 and #2  were removing all equipment related to the leg  elevator and distributor. Coworker #1 was operating a manual chain hoist to  lower portions of equipment (flow retarder  cushion and/or baffle) just above  where the already removed distributor would have been. Coworker #2 was in the  process of cutting the four thread bolts that held the equipment together. The  second bolt needed to be cut but could not be reached from the catwalk on  which Coworker #2 stood. Coworker #2 had left his fall protection equipment in  the trailer. Therefore  Employee #2 used his fall arrest system and tied off  on the super structure. He was standing approximately 9 feet above the  walking/working surface  that is  the top of the silo. The equipment they were  removing had one open hole in the top and one open hole in the bottom. It was  a very windy day. Employee #1 used an oxy-acetylene torch to cut the second  bolt. Combustible dust exploded and created a flash fire  which caused  Employee #1 to fall. Employee #1's 6-foot Protecta brand shock absorbing  lanyard partially activated and broke his fall. Coworker #1 called for  emergency services and then helped Employee #1 remove his harness  enter an  aerial lift  and return to the ground. Employee #1 was transported by  emergency response personnel to the nearest hospital and then flown to a  hospital burn unit in Iowa City. He was hospitalized and treated for burns to  his arms  face  head  and neck.",

        "text": "At approximately 9:00 a.m. on July 8  2013  Employee #1  with 4 Granite Inc.   was attaching a light pole (14 ft tall and 2.5 in. in diameter) to a new  guardrail that had been installed on top of a 13 in. high concrete curb. The  light pole was a plastic pipe with two lights  4 square ft  held 3 ft apart  and angled out to a total width of about 76 ins. It weighed approximately 125  pounds  and its center of gravity was estimated to have been about 9.5 ft from  the bottom. Two brackets made from angle iron had been welded to the  guardrail. One bracket was at approximately 29 ins. above the ground  and the  other was at approximately 53 ins. above the ground. Two holes were drilled  into each bracket to accommodate a U-bolt to hold the light pole in place.  Employee #1  and a coworker  lifted the light pole up into place  and Employee  #1 installed the upper U-bolt. The bottom of the pole was on the outside of a  piece of electrical conduit. The pole had to be lifted up over the conduit so  the wiring could be attached. Employee #1's supervisor told Employee #1 and  his coworker to wait while the supervisor got some wood blocks to rest the  pole on  in order to raise the pole into the proper position before attaching  the lower U-bolt. While the supervisor was gone  the coworker attempted to  lift the light pole up and over the conduit  so that it would rest in between  the conduit and the wall. The coworker used a 4 ft crowbar to lift the pole up  at its base. The coworker held the pole with one hand and held the crowbar  with the other. Employee #1 was reaching out over the coworker's shoulder to  give him room to work and was holding the pole with one hand to steady it.  Employee #1 did not have control of the pole. Each employee thought the other  was in control of the top-heavy light pole. When the coworker pried the pole  up  it rotated counter-clockwise around the upper bracket. Employee #1's right  thumb was caught between the pole and the upper rail of the guardrail.  Employee #1 suffered an avulsion (skin torn off to the skeleton) to the pad of  his right thumb. He underwent surgery to amputate a portion of the right  thumb. This accident was caused by the misjudgment of a hazardous situation   specifically  attempting to use a crowbar to lift a tall  top-heavy light  pole. Secondary factors were poor body positioning for the task  and a lack of  proper communication between Employee #1 and the coworker about who was  supporting the pole.",

Employee #1  who was on the ladder  cut this coaxial cable  which  caused the ladder and the aerial strand wire to move outwards and away from  the house.

He mounted the ladder  facing the  eave  and stepped on the ladder with his left leg first and both hands on the  ladder. As he descended  the ladder kicked out at the bottom. Employee #1 fell  from the top of the ladder  which was approximately 9.08 ft  and landed on the  deck. He sustained a strain of his left upper arm and shoulder and contusions  on his face  scalp and neck in the fall. Employee #1 was transported to a  medical center. At the medical center  Employee #1 underwent treatment  after  which he was released from the hospital. A causal factor in the accident was  that the ladder was placed on the eave  at the natural low point of the roof;  however  the metal gutter prevented the use of ladder locks on the roof  which  result in the top of the ladder not being secured.",
