        "text": " At around 10:00 p.m. on November 10  2013  Employee #1  with Villager  Construction Inc.  with a coworker  were using an asphalt milling machine  (Wirtgen; Model Number: W2100) to grind out existing asphalt from an  interstate at a railroad bridge overpass. Employee # 1 was standing on the  ground  checking the depth of the cut into the asphalt  using a handheld  pendant attached to the machine. The pedant could stretch out from ten to 15  ft. This allowed Employee #1 to walk back and forth  checking the cut. The  operator was on the top of the milling machine  controlling the operation of  the machine and ensuring that the milling machine and dump truck (driven by a  second coworker  who worked for an independent trucking service) kept a safe  working distance. A different company  Protective Services Inc. (PSI)  was  responsible for the traffic control of the job site and had shut down the  inside lane of a three lane section of the interstate  so that work could be  conducted on that lane. The entire work zone was approximately two miles long   from start to finish. Employee #1 and the operator of the milling machine had  completed milling four sections (eight total passes) of the inside lane at the  bridge overpasses and were waiting for PSI to shut down the center lane. Dual  lane shut down of the inside and center lanes of the interstate was completed  around 9:30 p.m.  and Employee #1 and the milling machine operator milled two  sections (four total passes) of the center lane. Once both sides of the  overpass were milled out  approximately 200 ft on each side  Employee #1 and  the operator of the milling machine moved the milling machine down the  interstate  approximately1 000 ft  to a railroad overpass and began setting up  to mill the center lane sections. The truck driver backed his truck into  position and remained in the truck to move the truck slowly forward as milling  took place. Employee #1 was positioned between the milling machine and the  concrete median dividers  inside the coned off work zone. The lanes of travel  were approximately 12 ft wide  so the milling machine made two passes  since  it can only cut seven ft wide on each section to cover the entire lane.  Employee #1 was standing approximately three ft in the far inside lane on the  ground between milling machine and interior median wall inside of the approved  traffic control set up  and approximately midway up the machine and 17 ft from  the traffic control devices and flow of traffic. The milling machine was  approximately nine ft wide by 50 ft long  while operating. Employee #1 was  guarded by the machine from the flow of traffic. Approximately five to ten  minutes into the first pass  the milling machine operator noticed lights  hitting the reflectors on the inside wall and turned briefly to see a vehicle  coming. The operator thought it was the Project manager coming to check on the  status of the project. Then  the operator realized that the oncoming vehicle  was not equipped with a strobe  as required in work zones. The operator turned  and yelled for Employee # 1 to run for safety  as a Chevrolet Tahoe came down  the inside lane where Employee #1 was standing. The driver of the Tahoe  continued traveling in the far inside lane of the work zone  where Employee #1  was struck and thrown some 100 ft from where he was originally standing. The  vehicle was moving approximately 45 mph per hour. As he was transferred to a  hospital by emergency personnel  Employee #1 was treated for severe trauma   lacerations  fractures  and contusions to the body and head. Employee #1 was  pronounced dead at the hospital. The driver of the vehicle disregarded the  traffic control set up  all warning lights on the rear of the milling machine   and cone spacing of 100 ft. The construction work zone was set up correctly  with all signage  cone spacing  tapering  attenuators  and lighting; all of  the traffic control set up was approved by MUTCD for this type of tr ",

They scraped the interiors of the  building and collected debris as they finished up the job. On August 28  2012   at approximately 10:00 a.m  the job assignment was done and every employee was  to put away all the rubble and gather all equipment in order to pack up and  leave the site. When the job assignment was finished  it is typical for all  employees to gather everything and put it away into the garbage bin or in  their trailers and bins. At the time  four coworkers were outside in the  parking lot working near the Number 5 700 Panther. Two coworkers were going to  load the number 5 700 Panther and Employee #1 stated that he was going to load  the number 5 700 Panther on a trailer when their trailer returns from the trip  delivering their first load. This worker got on a Gradall machine to lift a  box bin and move it towards the number 5 700 Panther. The coworkers stated  that Employee #1  not the employee designated to drive the Panther  got on  this vehicle and started driving it. Employee #1 attempted to load a number  5 700 Panther on to a bin. This bin had a rubber lip with a four to five inch  incline ramp on its lip's edge. Employee #1 drove the Panther straight  backwards on the bin and did not go through this four to five inch ramp bump  on to the bin. Right after this unsuccessful attempt  Employee #1 drove it  backwards a second time except this time slightly slanted to his left side.  The left wheel touched the ramp first. On this second attempt  the number  5 700 Panther fell and flipped over. Employee #1 attempted to jump out of this  vehicle but was unable to get away as the Panther which weighed over 2 000  pounds fell on his left foot and pinned it. A coworker got the Gradall  machinery in order to remove the Panther that was on top of Employee #1's left  foot. Employee #1 suffered a serious fracture injury to his left leg and was  hospitalized over twenty-four hours. Employee #1 also stated that he is well  trained in driving other construction vehicle equipment by another foreman.     ",

Upon further investigation  it was learned that nine days prior to this event   the local electric municipal dug and backfilled an underground line from a  transformer to the residential dwelling with a trenching machine that made 4  in. to 6 in. wide cuts at a 4 ft to 5 ft depth. The trench wall ran adjacent  to the previously trenched electrical line by 2.5 ft.

The hopper section  consisted of 1-in. plate steel. The plates were welded vertically to the deck  and the side plates were welded at an angle with steel I beams for support to  deflect material to the center. The plates were approximately 8 ft high. The  barge was used to catch construction debris from a bridge that was being  demolished. After Employee #1 released the cable  a coworker who was operating  a tug boat  put the boat at notch one in reverse to back the barge out from  under the bridge. After moving approximately 2 ft the barge listed to  starboard approximately 6 to12 inches. It then rolled back to port the same  distance  then back to even keel. It then rolled back to port and capsized  both vessels. As the vessels were rolling to the port side  Employee #1 jumped  into the water and started to swim away. The coworker  at almost the same  time  jumped from the pilot house and swam away.

They were inside a 6 000 square foot  containment with 14 foot ceilings  using a propane-powered floor scraper to  remove the two layers of flooring and most of the mastic from the concrete  subfloor. One employee was driving the scraper while others sprayed a wetting  agent and shoveled the flooring into bags. After using the floor-scraping  machine for approximately 3 hours  the employees began to experience nausea  and dizziness. Emergency Services was called and all ten workers were  transported to the hospital for evaluation and treatment. Their highest  blood-gas readings were in the low 20s  but none suffered permanent injury.  Two 2 000-cubic-foot-per-minute negative air machines were being used to  evacuate air from the containment. The floor scraper was a Terminator 2   manufactured by the Innovatech Products and Equipment Company. It was designed  to emit 40 parts per million of carbon monoxide at the tailpipe  but testing  during the inspection showed that it was emitting 10 000 parts per million.

Employee #2 called out to a coworker that Employee #1 was down and  then entered the vault through the manhole and climb down the ladder. The  coworker came over to the manhole and saw Employee #1 on the ground and  Employee #2 hanging upside down  with his leg caught between the ladder rungs.  Neither employee responded to the coworker's calls and he started down the  manhole. The coworker also started down the manhole but noticed an  overpowering musty odor and abruptly stopped and exited. The Fire Department  and paramedics responded to the job site and retrieved Employees #1 and #2   both of whom had died. At the time of rescue the Fire Department's four gas  meters measured the oxygen level in the vault at approximately 9.2 ppm. In its  referral to OSHA  the Fire Department referenced two workers who succumbed to  an IDLH atmosphere.                                                             ",

The property owner  had asked if the demolition company wanted to remove a boiler from another   unused building and keep the scrap metal as payment. The demolition company  had agreed  and the boiler removal was to occur on June 19. Employee #1   working as a laborer  was assigned to assist the supervisor. On the previous  day  June 18  2013  the supervisor and the building owner had walked to the  building where the boiler was located. They had discussed the removal  and  whether the utilities  such as water  gas  and electricity  had been turned  off. The owner indicated they had been turned off. The supervisor did not ask  the owner whether the utility company had turned them off or whether the owner  had directed his own workers to turn them off. Employee #1 and the supervisor  began working on the boiler removal at approximately 7:00 a.m. on June 19.  According to the supervisor's statement during the subsequent investigation   the supervisor first opened valves on the boiler to check whether there was  any pressure  with water or fumes coming out. He then went to the meter  outside and removed one plug to check for pressure in the lines. He did not  notice any pressure or fumes. Then he and Employee #1 proceeded to cut the  pipes. There were approximately 50 pipes that needed to be cut. Employee #1  was using a gas powered chop saw  and the supervisor was using an acetylene  powered cutting torch. They worked all morning. At approximately 1:30 p.m.   Employee #1 cut into a pipe  and a fire ignited. Employee #1 was seriously  burned. His supervisor called emergency services  and the Carpinteria  Summerland Fire Protection District responded. Employee #1 was transported to  Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital  where he was admitted and treated for third  degree burns to his face  arms  and upper torso. He remained hospitalized for  several weeks. The Carpinteria Summerland Fire Protection District reported  this event to Cal/OSHA at 4:54 p.m. on June 19  2013.

Employee #1 was  taken to St. Francis Hospital  where he stayed approximately 1 week in the  burn unit. Before it was extinguished  this fire burned three adjacent  buildings. The incident was reported to the Cal/OSHA Division by the San  Francisco Fire Department on June 12  2012. A Cal/OSHA Engineer conducted an  investigation at the construction jobsite on June 13  2012. Employee #1   Employee #2 (the foreman)  the general contractor (Employee #1's employer)   and neighboring businesses were interviewed during the course of the  investigation. The employer was cited a serious accident-related violation. T8  GISO '3382(a) requires eye protection where there is a risk of receiving eye  injuries due to burns. Employee #1 was soldering in close proximity to a high  pressure gas line. He was not provided adequate protection. The employer also  was cited for failing to notify the Division of the incident. Other violations  were observed  and the employer was cited accordingly.                          ",

The panel was secured in the vertical position  utilizing the auxiliary hook block of the crane. The main hook block of the  crane had no load it at the time  but had become bound up on a piece of  2-in.-by-6-in. wood at the top back side of the pre-cast panel. The top was  approximately 79 ft above the ground. The site superintendent told three  employees to go up in the articulating boom lift to where the block was bound  and free it up. One of the employees grabbed the block itself while the other  two grabbed the 0.875-in. wire rope supporting the 2127-pound block. Without  warning any of the employees on the lift  the superintendent signaled the  crane operator to move the crane block. Employee #1 got his hand caught by the  0.875-in. cable going around the hook blocks sheaves and suffered a crushing  injury and amputation of four fingers on his left hand. Employee #1 was  treated for his injuries but was not hospitalized.                              ",

Employee #1  who was  operating the left car  was at ground level  while the right car was at level  15  picking up a drywall worker to take down.

The employer  was engaged in design  build  and construction management services. It  specialized in commercial  agricultural  industrial  and residential  construction. Employee #1 had joined the company on July 2  2012. He attended  once a week safety meetings conducted at the job site. He did not receive  specific safety training on the subject of assisting during the loading of  material. Employee #1 and a coworker had been assigned by a foreman to pick up  17 sheets of particle board in a storage yard. The coworker was operating a  JLG Model Number 10054 Skytrak aerial lift  with Serial Number 0160044376  to  pick up the particle board. First  the coworker used one fork to push the top  17 particle boards off the rest of the stack. Then he used one fork to lift  the corner of these particle boards. Employee #1 was asked to put a 2-inch by  4-inch by 20-inch (50-millimeter by 100-millimeter by 0.51-meter) piece of  scrap lumber underneath the top 17 sheets at the center of the particle  boards. This was being done so that forks could later go underneath the boards  and raise them. When Employee #1 stuck his hand under the boards to adjust the  scrap lumber  the 17 sheets of particle boards slammed down on his hand. The  load slipped and fell on Employee #1's hands  causing finger injuries. His  thumb was crushed and amputated  and his index and middle fingers were injured  as well. Factors contributing to the accident included failure to balance the  load and failure to brace and secure it to prevent it from tipping and falling  (Title 8 3650 (l).
